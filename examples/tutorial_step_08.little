; The language has several binary operators for
; arithmetic. To operate on three numbers, use a
; binary operation twice.

(def foo (\(x y) [(+ x y) (* x y) (/ x y)]))

(def multiply3 (\(x y z) (* x (* y z))))

(def main
  (draw [
    (show (foo 3 4))
  ]))

; EXERCISE: Call the multiply3 function.
;
; EXERCISE: Write a function add4 to add four numbers.
