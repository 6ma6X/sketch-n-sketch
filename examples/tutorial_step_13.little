Right-click the editor and select <em>Create Function</em> from the pop-up menu.</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Text-Select Mode (Code Tools menu)</h3><p>Text-select the entire <code>(def redSquare ...)</code> expression starting from its opening parenthesis until its closing parenthesis. Select <em>Create Function</em> from the Code Tools menu.</p></li><li class="_3"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down the Shift key, hover over the keyword <code>def</code> in <code>(def redSquare   ...)</code>, then click. Release the Shift key. Select <em>Create Function</em> from the pop-up menu.</p></li></ul><p>No matter how the <em>Create Function</em> tool is invoked, there are two options in the results list that we can select from. Because the point of this function is to draw a <em>red</em> square, we'll pick the option that does not make color one of the resulting function arguments.</p><p>Notice how the reference to this expression in main has now turned into a function call.</p><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Perform the transformation with each of the three interactions.
