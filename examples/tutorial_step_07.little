; The language has several binary operators...

(def foo (\(x y) [(+ x y) (- x y) (* x y) (/ x y)]))

(def multiply3 (\(x y z) (* x (* y z))))

; ... and if-then-else expressions.

(def max (\(x y)
  (if (< x y) y x)))

; Don't worry about the syntax too much.

(def main
  (draw [
    (show (foo 3 4))
  ]))

; EXERCISE: Call the multiply3 and max functions.
