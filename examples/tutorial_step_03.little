; The language has several kinds of data: strings,
; numbers, booleans, and lists.

(def str "hello world!")
(def num 3.14)
(def bool true)
(def list
  [1 2 3 true [false "abc"] str num bool])

(def main
  (draw [(show list)]))

; Lists are written with square brackets and with
; spaces separating the elements.
;
; The language does not have static types, so we
; can mix and match different types of elements
; within a list.
