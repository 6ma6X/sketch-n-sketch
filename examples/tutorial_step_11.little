; <!-- PROSE --> <p>Many times, when using a function like rect, passing in multiple constants rather than named variables can lead to confusion as to the purpose of each constant.</p><p>To alleviate this, we can introduce variables using the Introduce Variable tool. This tool uses the notion of a &quot;target position&quot;, which is the whitespace between or above other items in the code. Target positions typically allow us to select where we want resultant transformations to appear in the code. In the case of the Introduce Variable tool, the target position indicates where we would like the variables to be introduced.</p><p>Let's try out the Introduce Variable tool on the x- and y- positions of the red square (the first two arguments of the rect function after the color, &quot;salmon&quot;).</p><p>As before, we can use this tool in three ways:</p><ul class="_123"><li class="_1">Text-Select Mode (right-click menu): <br><br> Text-select one of the 100s, right-click, then select Introduce Variable from the pop-up menu. The configuration panel asks for one or more expressions for which variables will be introduced, as well as an optional target position. Click the other 100, then click a target position before the call to rect or above the def. Apply the transformation from the results list.</li><li class="_2">Text-Select Mode (Code Tools menu): <br><br> Text-select one of the 100s, then select Introduce Variable from the Code Tools menu. The configuration panel asks for one or more expressions for which variables will be introduced, as well as an optional target positions. Click the other 100, then click a target position before the call to rect or above the def. Apply the transformation from the results list.</li><li class="_3">Box-Select Mode: <br><br> Hold down Shift, then click on both occurrences of the number 100 as well as a target position before the call to rect or above the def. Release the Shift key and select Introduce Variables from the pop-up menu. Apply the transformation from the results list.</li></ul><p>EXERCISE: Introduce x and y variables with each of the three interactions. Use Undo after each to reset the program.</p>
