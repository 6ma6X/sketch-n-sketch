; <!-- PROSE --> <p>Here is the incorrectly-named red square again. Besides selecting <em>Rename Variable</em> directly from the Code Tools menu, there are a few ways additional ways to invoke the <em>Rename</em> tool:</p><ul class="_123"><li class="_1"><h3>Text-Select Mode (right-click menu)</h3><p>Select the text <code>blueSquare</code>, right-click the editor, and select the <em>Rename</em> tool from the pop-up menu. Then, enter a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the results list and press Enter.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Escape key will make the menu or panel go away. <em>⟲ Undo</em> will let you go back.</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Text-Select Mode (Code Tools menu)</h3><p>Select the text <code>blueSquare</code>, and select the <em>Rename</em> Variable tool from the Code Tools menu at the top-left of the screen. Then enter a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the results list and press Enter.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Escape key will make the panel go away. <em>⟲ Undo</em> will let you go back.</p></li><li class="_3"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down the Shift key, hover over <code>blueSquare</code>, click the box that pops up over <code>blueSquare</code>, and then release the Shift key. Select the <em>Rename</em> tool from the pop-up menu. Enter a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the results list and press Enter.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Escape key will clear any selections and make the menu go away. <em>⟲ Undo</em> will let you go back.</p></li></ul><p>Unlike with text edits, you do <em>not</em> need to hit the Run button after invoking a code transformation.</p><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Perform the renaming with each of the three interactions. Use Undo after each to reset the program.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To save time in Text-Select Mode, a right-click can be performed without a text selection for <em>variables</em> and <em>constants</em> (but not for more complicated expressions). In this case, Sketch-n-Sketch will automatically select the variable or constant that contains the click that was performed. Try this out by redoing the instructions for <em>Text-Select Mode (right-click menu)</em>, this time by right-clicking <code>blueSquare</code> without text-selecting it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tip:</strong> The pop-up panels can be re-positioned if they are covering up relevant parts of the code. Redo any one of the interactions and, when a pop-up panel appears, click and drag the top bar to move it somewhere else.</p></li></ol>
