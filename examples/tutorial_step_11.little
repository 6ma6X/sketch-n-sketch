; <!-- PROSE --> <p>Many times, when using a function like <code>rect</code>, passing in multiple constants rather than named variables can lead to confusion as to the purpose of each constant.</p><p>To alleviate this, we can introduce variables using the <em>Introduce Variable</em> tool. This tool uses the notion of a <em>target position</em>, which is the whitespace between or above other items in the code. Target positions typically allow us to select where we want resultant transformations to appear in the code. In the case of the <em>Introduce Variable</em> tool, the target position indicates where we would like the variables to be introduced.</p><p>Let's try out the <em>Introduce Variable</em> tool on the x- and y- positions of the red square (the first two arguments of the <code>rect</code> function after the color, &quot;salmon&quot;).</p><p>We can use this code tool (and all others) in two main ways:</p><ul class="_12"><li class="_1"><h3>Text-Select Mode</h3><p>Text-select one of the <code>80</code>s, then either right-click the editor or click on the Code Tools menu at the top of the screen. From either of these menus, select <em>Introduce Variable</em>. The configuration panel asks for one or more expressions for which variables will be introduced, as well as an optional target position. Click the other <code>80</code>, then click a target position before the call to rect or above the def. Apply the transformation from the results list.</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down Shift, then click on both occurrences of the number <code>80</code> as well as a target position before the call to <code>rect</code> or above the def. Release the Shift key and select <em>Introduce Variables</em> from the pop-up menu. Apply the transformation from the results list.</p></li></ul><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Introduce x and y variables with each of the two interactions.
