; <!-- PROSE --> <p>In this code snippet, the rectangle should have sides of equal length, but the width and height (fourth and fifth) arguments of the <code>rect</code> function call are not equal. The <em>Make Equal by Copying</em> tool can be used to copy one expression to replace one or more other expressions.</p><p>As with all Sketch-n-Sketch code tools, there are two main ways that we can use the <em>Make Equal by Copying</em> tool:</p><ul class="_12"><li class="_1"><h3>Text-Select Mode</h3><p>Text-select either <code>120</code> or <code>80</code>. Then, either right-click the editor or click on the Code Tools menu at the top of the screen. From either of these menus, select <em>Make Equal by Copying</em>. Click on the remaining number (either <code>120</code> or <code>80</code>). Click on one of the results from the list that appears to apply the transformation.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> in Text-Select Mode, a SINGLE, primary argument is selected FIRST, then the desired tool is selected, and then the rest of the arguments are selected AFTERWARD (as required by the configuration panel).</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down Shift, then click on <code>120</code> and <code>80</code>. Release the Shift key and select <em>Make Equal by Copying</em> from the pop-up menu. Click on one of the results from the list that appears to apply the transformation.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> in Box-Select Mode, ALL arguments are selected first, BEFORE the desired code transformation is selected.</p></li></ul><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Fix the <code>redSquare</code> definition using each of the two interactions.
