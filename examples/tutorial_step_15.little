; <!-- PROSE --> <p>Thinking back on the previous example, we successfully turned the rectangle into a square by copying the width and height values. But now if we want to change the size of the square, we must remember to change <em>both</em> values in sync.</p><p>Instead, we may want a single variable to take the place of multiple expressions (in this case, the width and height). The <em>Make Equal with Single Variable</em> tool does just that.</p><p>We can invoke <em>Make Equal with Single Variable</em> in two main ways:</p><ul class="_12"><li class="_1"><h3>Text-Select Mode</h3><p>Text-select either <code>120</code> or <code>80</code>. Then, either right-click the editor or click on the Code Tools menu at the top of the screen. From either of these menus, select <em>Make Equal with Single Variable</em>. Click on the remaining number (either <code>120</code> or <code>80</code>). Click on one of the results from the list that appears to apply the transformation.</p><p><strong>Reminder:</strong> in Text-Select Mode, a SINGLE, primary argument is selected FIRST, then the desired tool is selected, and then the rest of the arguments are selected AFTERWARD (as required by the configuration panel).</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down Shift, then click on <code>120</code> and <code>80</code>. Release the Shift key and select <em>Make Equal with Single Variable</em> from the pop-up menu. Click on one of the results from the list that appears to apply the transformation.</p><p><strong>Reminder:</strong> in Box-Select Mode, ALL arguments are selected first, BEFORE the desired code transformation is selected.</p></li></ul><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Fix the <code>redSquare</code> definition using each of the two interactions.
