Then, enter a new name (like redSquare) in the results list and press Enter.</li><li class="_2">Text-Select Mode (Code Tools menu): <br><br> Select the text blueSquare, and select the Rename Variable tool from the Code Tools menu at the top left of the screen. Then enter a new name (like redSquare) in the results list and press Enter.</li><li class="_3">Box-Select Mode: <br><br> Hold down the Shift key, hover over blueSquare, click the box that pops up over blueSquare, and then release the Shift key. Select the Rename tool from the pop-up menu. Enter a new name (like redSquare) in the results list and press Enter.</li></ul><p>EXERCISE: Perform the renaming with each of the three interactions. Use Undo after each to reset the program.</p>
