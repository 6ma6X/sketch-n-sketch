; <!-- PROSE --> <p>Here is a red square. Unfortunately, the name of the function that generates this red square is incorrect. To fix this, we can use one of the <em>code tools</em> that are built in to Sketch-n-Sketch.</p><p>The Code Tools menu at the top-left of the screen lists all of the tools. In this case, we want the <em>Rename Variable</em> to rename the variable at its definition on line 2 and its use on line 6.</p><h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Choose the <em>Rename Variable</em> tool from the Code Tools menu. The configuration panel that appears asks for a variable to be selected. Hover over and click <code>blueSquare</code> either on line 2 or line 6. Notice that the Code Updates section of the configuration panel now displays a text box in which to enter a new name. Type a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the text box and press Enter. Notice how the variable definition and use are changed. Unlike with text edits, you do <em>not</em> need to hit the Run button after invoking a code transformation.</li></ol>
