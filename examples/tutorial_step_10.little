Then, enter a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the results list and press Enter.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Escape key will make the menu or panel go away. <em>⟲ Undo</em> will let you go back.</p></li><li class="_2"><h3>Text-Select Mode (Code Tools menu)</h3><p>Select the text <code>blueSquare</code>, and select the <em>Rename</em> Variable tool from the Code Tools menu at the top-left of the screen. Then enter a new name (like <code>redSquare</code>) in the results list and press Enter.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Escape key will make the panel go away. <em>⟲ Undo</em> will let you go back.</p></li><li class="_3"><h3>Box-Select Mode</h3><p>Hold down the Shift key, hover over <code>blueSquare</code>, click the box that pops up over <code>blueSquare</code>, and then release the Shift key.
