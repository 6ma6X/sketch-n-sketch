; <!-- PROSE --> <p>In addition to top-level definitions, local variables can be created using a different keyword called let. For example, within the nums def we can define the local variable one to hold the value 1, and then refer to that value with the name one in the rest of the let-expression.</p><p>The syntax for a let definition is (let x e1 e2), which says let x refer to e1 when evaluating e2. Notice how parentheses surround the entire let definition.</p><p>The binding of x is only in scope in the expression e2. For example, the one variable above is not in scope outside of the nums definition.</p><p>EXERCISE: Try referencing the one variable outside the nums definition.</p><p>EXERCISE: Tuple patterns can be used in let definitions. Define the tuple pattern [one two] to be [1 2] inside nums.</p>
