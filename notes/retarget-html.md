# Retarget-HTML Goals

Things to work on:

* ~~'Absolute'/'Overall' CSS declarations~~
    * Some tyding up is in order
    * Style collection should walk 'up' to nearest 'html' node, in case of
      strange things
* Zones for Padding/Margin
* Traces on Strings for Textarea Zones
    * Hold off on this for now
* Element Abstraction
* 'Pausing' the canvas to allow editing in different states
* Zoom/pan in iframe, can be done with CSS 
* ~~Zone mode to show no zones~~
* Recreate a basic website to get an idea of current workflow
    * In progess, see Basic Page example

Things to talk about:

* Syntax for singleton list
* Rebasing with master (priority level)
* Syntax shorthand for text (just use a string - feasible/desirable?)
* Newlines in strings (pain point)
* Working with typically derived quantities (namely text width)
* Limiting Zones to the iframe
