The goal for this video is to try and convey the type of image manipulation that
Sketch-n-Sketch enables the user to do. The point of the different examples is
to demonstrate a particular use case and advantage to prodirect manipulation as
realized in Sketch-n-Sketch.

There's a few approaches we could take with the narration in this video, but I
think the best way to go is a "disinterested, broad strokes" approach. In other
words, not trying to explain everything that is going on, but matter-of-factly
stating the type of interaction that occurs when using the tool while pointing 
out its particular advantages.

## Intro (5 Seconds)
Enough time to basically say the name and a tagline.

"Sketch-n-Sketch is a tool for the manipulation of Scaled Vector Graphics
images."

## Example 1 (Three boxes) (1 min 25 sec)
Developing the three box example from the \*Scratch\* example.

"Sketch-n-Sketch allows the creation of images by writing programs in a simple
functional language. Running the program produces an output which is displayed
in the window. Attributes of the image, such as the size and position of shapes,
can then be directly manipulated. As the output is manipulated, changes to
constants in the source program are inferred to make the program match the
newly specified output."

"The syntax allows for fine-grained specification of the image's manipulable
attributes and provides a novel method of design interaction for the creative 
process." 

## Example 2 (Sketch+Sketch Logo) (30 seconds)
Freezing constants and then manipulating the gutter of the logo.

"In this example, the design is specified in terms of a handful of parameters.
All the parameters start able to be changed, but can be specified as fixed to
prevent direct image manipulation from altering them. Qualities of the image
that would be difficult to adjust in a typical image editor can be exposed in a
natural way to the designer."

## Example 3 (Ferris Wheel) (1 minute)
Manipulating the ferris wheel using indirect sliders and getting the text SVG
output.

"The combination of programmatic and direct manipulation allows for meaningful
[tangible?] manipulation of attributes in complex designs. In this example
paramaters that do not have a direct representation in the output, such as the
number of spokes on the ferris wheel, are manipulated using helper objects that
were created by the designer. Changes that would be difficult to realize in a
typical image editing environment, such as rotation of the wheel while keeping
the 'cars' level, are done in an intuitive manner."

"The output is completely valid SVG, and can be copied to be used anywhere that
SVG can."

"Sketch-n-Sketch comes with a wide range of examples to serve as a reference for
the features of the language and to hint at the variety of designs that it can
be used to make."

How to end?

"As you use the tool, let us know what you think, and what features you would
find most useful. The tool is under active development and we appreciate your
feedback."

"This tool provides a truly novel method of creating images and is a new way to
carry out the creative process. We're continuing to add new features, and
encourage you to check back frequently to see what has been added."

links to our source code [our development logs? site?]."
