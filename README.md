Sketch-N-Sketch: Program Synthesis for Direct Manipulation

## Example Use Cases
Below are some examples of SVG images that demonstrate a particular use case of
this tool.

### Three Squares
* This canonical example consists of three squares, equally spaced on a plain
canvas. Manipulating different attributes of each of the squares is a good
demonstration of the basic functionality of the tool.

### Grid of Shapes
* This is an extension of the first example to two dimensions. This shows how the
'solving' that happens for the deduced changes can quickly get complicated and
serves as a good example of the types of changes that this tool makes easier, as
well as what classes of changes it is not appropriate for.

### Loading Animations
* One such animation could consist of a simple gradient on a circle that
rotates with a fixed angular speed. This demonstrates the support for animations
of the tool as well as how the usual benefits of this approach remain helpful in
this use case.
* More involved examples could consist of a single circle orbiting another
circle. Direct manipulation operations on such animations could involve (besides
the established translation, scalng, etc. of our base models) modification of
speed, movement, and direction.

### Manipulating Infographics
* A histogram where there are several traits shared by each bar and where
otherwise time consuming and finnicky manipulations are simple. Namely,
manipulating the width of the bars, the spacing of the bars, and the height of
the bars. Further, a demsonstration of adding a drop shadow to all of the bars
using simple geometries would be good.

### Styling and Formatting Text
* The styling, formatting and arrangement by direct manipulation of output text
would be useful for projects such as presentations and informational pieces.
This would be particularly noticeable when arranging text in relation to other
objects on a canvas.
