# How to Run Sketch-n-Myth



1. Install opam, the OCaml package manager, from

     https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html



2. Using opam, install OCaml v4.08.1. For more detailed instructions, see:

     https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html

   For best performance, use an installation of OCaml that supports flambda
   (e.g. `4.08.1+flambda` obtained via `opam switch create 4.08.1+flambda`).

   For more information, see:

     https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/flambda.html



3. Navigate to the `sketch-n-myth` directory and run `make deps` to download all
   the necessary opam dependencies.



4. In the `sketch-n-myth` directory, run the Sketch-n-Myth server with the
   command `make serve`. The server will be hosted on port 9090.



5. In a new terminal, navigate to the `build/out` directory from the root of
   the project.



6. Run a web server in the `build/out/` directory on any port other than 9090.
   For example, the following command would work:

     php -S localhost:7532



7. Open a browser with cross-origin resource sharing temporarily allowed. For
   example, the following command will open Google Chrome on a Mac with
   cross-origin resource sharing allowed:

     open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=\"\"

   This step is necessary because we are running local servers on two different
   ports (which counts as being a separate domain).



8. In the newly-opened browser window, navigate to `localhost:7532`, where 7532
   should be substituted for the port number used in Step 6.



9. Click on the "Sketch-n-Myth" menu at the top to run the benchmarking suite in
   its entirety, or view individual programs by clicking on the "File" menu then
   selecting "Open from PBE Suite".
