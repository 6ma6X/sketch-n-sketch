    This is a non-exhaustive list of project ideas for Sketch-n-Sketch:
    <ul>
    <li>Sketch-n-Sketch is the core of our approach. It features a functional programming language, Leo, and a parser, an interpreter, reverse interpreters and an unparser. Look at the videos on the home tab of this website to get a better impression of its capabilities. Some ideas to improve Sketch-n-Sketch:
      <ul>
        <li>Create or import a lossless PHPÂ parser and unparser to support PHP as a front-end language</li>
        <li>Create or import a lossless Python parser and unparser to support Python as a front-end language</li>
        <li>Support database reading and writing, similar to the current file system</li>
        <li>Create automatic documentation of the prelude files from its source</li>
        <li>Implement lazily computed values</li>
        <li>Invent and use an import function to split the (currently huge) prelude library and load functions on demand.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href=
              "https://github.com/MikaelMayer/Editor">Editor</a
        > is an HTTPS server serving dynamic pages written in Leo, HTML or Markdown. It offers the possibility to edit these pages. Some ideas to improve Editor:
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of reloading the new page, merge the modifications with the current user's modifications</li
            ><li>Better UI toolkit: Design a context menu or toolbar to edit element attributes or styles, similar to the current hyperlink editor. We should also be able to select an element's parent.</li
            ><li>Better editability: Currently, ENTER and TAB are managed by contenteditable, which is not working as expected in most browsers, making it very hard to edit a webpage's content. We want to better interpret user's actions (splitting a paragraph, nested &lt;ul&gt;...)</li
            ><li>Interactive styling toolkit: Instead of changing only an element's inline styling attribute, we want to offer interactive ways to update also inline and external stylesheets.</li>
            <li>Integration with github.io: Currently, Editor has to run locally. It would nice to design an online proxy that could open github.io's pages, and enable user to modify them online, using Editor's interface.</li>
            <li>Hot reloading: Make editor detect when an html file being viewed is changed, and reload the page, possibly merging unsaved user's modifications</li>
            <li>Database support: Enable Editor to view SQL databases and modify them.</li>
            <li>Performance: send modifications to the page instead of the entire page</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/MikaelMayer/hyde-build-tool">Hyde</a> is a reversible build tool mainly for building static websites from sources. It is agnostic, in the sense the user has to configure a hydefile to explicitly frame how to build the final html files. Some ideas to improve Hyde:
        <ul>
        <li>Create a default hydefile to support Jekyll's websites, so that with Editor these sites become reversible</li>
        <li>Similarly, create a default hydefile to support <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Go hugo</a></li>
        <li>Make hyde-powered websites on github.io editable from the browser</li>
      </ul>
