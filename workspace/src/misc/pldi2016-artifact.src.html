<b>Programmatic and Direct Manipulation, Together at Last</b></a>.

GitHub snapshot of Sketch-n-Sketch v0.5: <a href=""></a>
</p>

<p>
To help set the context for evaluating our artifacts, we
quote some descriptions from our submitted paper:
<ul>
<li>
<i>
Our implementation, examples, user study videos, and survey instrument (as
well as additional tutorial documentation) are publicly available and ready for
Artifact Evaluation.
</i>
(p.2)
</li>
<li>
<i>
Our goal with live synchronization [...] is to immediately a apply program
update during the user's actions.
</i>
(p.4)
</li>
<li>
<i>
The [examples] resemble typical programs in other functional
languages, but for the domain of SVG.
</i>
(p.7)
</li>
<li>
<i>
Sketch-n-Sketch is not a full-featured direct manipulation editor, 
nor is it a polished language implementation with rich
libraries and tools.
</i>
(p.9)
</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>
You can <a href="__ROOT__/releases/v0.5/index.html">try Sketch-n-Sketch</a>
right away by selecting an example using the dropdown menu and then directly
manipulating the visual output. To edit the program directly, click Edit
Code, type some changes, and then click Run Code to re-evaluate the program.
</p>

<h4>Examples from Paper</h4>

<p>
The examples depicted in Figure 3 are named
Wave Boxes, Logo, Botanic Garden Logo, Active Trans Logo,
Lillicon P, Chicago Flag, and Hilbert Curve Animation.
The examples depicted in Figure 3 are named
Widgets, Rounded Rect, and Tile Pattern.
The three tasks depicted in the user study videos are named
Ferris Task (Before/After),
Keyboard Task (Before/After), and
Tessellation Task (Before/After).
The Survey Results example implements the histograms in Figure 4.
The examples depicted in the Appendix are named
3 Boxes, Elm Logo, and Ferris Wheel.

        <h3>Documentation and Videos</h3>
<p>
To do more than directly manipulate examples that have already been written,
you will need to learn a bit about the syntax of Little and the features and
options in the Sketch-n-Sketch editor.
We provide the following resources, along with rough estimates
of how long you may decide to spend with them.
</p>

<h4><a href="__ROOT__/blog/03-user-study-videos.html">user study videos</a> (0 &ndash; 45 minutes)</h4>
<p>
Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 (approximately 20 minutes in total) provide
a high-level overview of Little and Sketch-n-Sketch.
</p>
<p>
Part 5 shows the tasks we developed for our user study; the survey
questions can be found in the Appendix to our paper.
</p>

<h4><a href="TODO">syntax guide</a> (0 &ndash; 1 hour)</h4>

<p>
The syntax guide defines the grammar for Little
as well as the encoding of SVG values.
To see a variety of Little programs, you may
<a href="">view the source code</a> for <tt>prelude.little</tt>
(automatically included in every program) and the examples.
</p>

<h4><a href="__ROOT__/tutorial/">tutorial</a> (1 &ndash; 5 hours)</h4>

<p>
This multi-part tutorial constitutes the most thorough introduction
to Sketch-n-Sketch as well as some more advanced uses.

        <h3>Additional Features</h3>

        color numbers, rotation TODO <br>

        <h3>Known Issues</h3>

<h4>Error Messages</h4>

<p>
Our tool currently does not report helpful error messages.
When there is a parse error, the caption "PARSE ERROR!" is
displayed under the output canvas without any additional
information.
<p>
</p>
When there is a run-time error, usually
the output canvas usually displays the string "[Little Error]"
(sometimes with the line and column numbers of the
offending expression) but sometimes a JavaScript exception
is raised (visible in the brower's Web Console). In the
latter case, reload the application.
</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

  Busting Stack on Firefox Linux TODO <br>
  
  Slow Time to Compute Triggers on Keyboard TODO

<h4>Parser</h4>
  
<p>
When a "<tt>(def x e1) e2</tt>" expression appears anywhere but
the top-level scope of the program, the unparser currently
inserts extra, unwanted whitespace. The workaround is to
use the equivalent let-expression form "<tt>(let x e1 e2)</tt>",
which can appear anywhere without sufferring this issue.
</p>

<h4>Resizing Panes</h4>

<p>
The pane separating the code and canvas can be resized.
If you stop dragging (by releasing the mouse) before the position
of the pane has caught up to the mouse position, the
editor may get stuck in a state where it resizes the panes upon each
successive click. In such situations, reload the application.

        <h3>Source Code</h3>

<p>
Our <a href="">implementation</a> is open source, but we have <i>not</i>
yet made an effort to organize and document it in a way that would make it
easy for others to extend.
If one wants to poke around anyway, here are a few pointers:
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""><tt>Lang.elm</tt></a>
defines the types of expressions and values in Little, without
any SVG-specific encodings.
</li>
<li>
SVG encodings are defined in <a href=""><tt>LangSvg.elm</tt></a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="">This part</a> of <tt>Sync.elm</tt>
shows our two simple solvers,
</li>
<li>
and <a href="">this part</a>
deals with the simple heuristics for disambiguation.
</li>
</ul>
