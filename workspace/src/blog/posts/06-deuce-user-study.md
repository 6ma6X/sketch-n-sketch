# Deuce User Study

*January 31, 2018* <br><br>

Last summer, we ran a user study to evaluate Deuce, as implemented in
[Sketch-n-Sketch v0.6.2][v062]. Check out our [ICSE 2018 paper][ICSEpaper]
for all the details.

Here is [the pared down, user-study version of the tool][userstudyversion]
(described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the paper) used by the user study
participants. Note: There will be many errors in the JavaScript console when
running this web application, because it was configured to communicate with a
server for logging during the study.

The unnarrated video below quickly clicks through all tutorial
steps, and then quickly (~5 minutes total) completes the
tasks without any pauses. To read the tasks, either launch
the [user study app][userstudyversion] or look in Appendix C.
Notes: (1) This video is not narrated.
(2) This video was recorded using a lighter color scheme
than deuce-user-study-version/index.html (the one used by
participants).
(3) For the Lambda task, the video shows a solution with one
more tool invoked (Move Definitions) than in the "optimal"
path listed in Table 1.
