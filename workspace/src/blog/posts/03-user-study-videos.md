# User Study Videos

*November 23, 2015* <br><br>


We recently ran a user study with 25 participants, who were asked to watch
the following videos and answer survey questions based on their observations.
These videos (also available as a [YouTube playlist][YouTube])
can be viewed as a general introduction to Sketch-n-Sketch.

* [00] <a href="#00">Combining Programmatic and Direct Manipulation</a> (02:54)
* [01] <a href="#01">Intro to Sketch-n-Sketch</a> (09:10)
* [02] <a href="#02">Basic Examples Using Variables</a> (02:21)
* [03] <a href="#03">Heuristics for Resolving Ambiguities</a> (06:34)
* [04] <a href="#04">Sliders</a> (03:25)
* [05] <a href="#05">Side-by-Side Comparisons</a> (22:02)

The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate the question:
"Are direct manipulation heuristics [in Sketch-n-Sketch] better or
worse than simply providing a slider for every constant in the program?"
To help answer this question, Video 5 provides side-by-side comparisons
of performing several tasks in Sketch-n-Sketch using different features.
See Section 7 of [this technical report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02988v2)
for details about the survey and results.

NOTE: Several videos below have Recap slides at the end. The videos
shown during the user study did not contain these Recaps.
