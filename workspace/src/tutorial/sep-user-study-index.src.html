        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Sketch-n-Sketch user study, and thanks for participating!
<!--
          We have had a lot of fun dreaming up and building this tool, so we are
          looking forward to hearing your feedback to help decide what features
          to add and improve.
-->
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial is designed to teach you the basics of how to use
          Sketch-n-Sketch. It is divided into five separate lessons, each
          designed to cover a few key topics. Each lesson discusses several
          examples, designed to be worked in
          <a href="http://ravichugh.github.io/sketch-n-sketch/releases/v0.3/">Sketch-n-Sketch v0.3</a>
          while you are reading.
          We have also sprinkled in a set of exercises in each lesson that we hope
          will offer instructive and fun opportunities to get your hands dirty.
          Very roughly speaking, we expect each lesson to take
          approximately one to three hours, with the last two (optional) lessons
          covering somewhat more advanced material.
          But, your mileage may vary depend on
          your background and interests... and how much pleasure or pain
          you're experiencing with the tool!
        </p>
        <p>
          To help us understand what aspects of Sketch-n-Sketch and this
          tutorial work well and what aspects need improvement, we have
          placed brief survey questions at the end of each lesson, as well as at
          the end of the entire sequence. Please fill out the surveys as you
          work through the tutorial, as opposed to all at once at the end,
          because we are interested to hear how your reactions and thoughts
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please submit your surveys by
          <span style="color:red;"><b>Friday, September 18, 2015</b></span>.
          We encourage you to fill out the <a href="exit.html">Exit Survey</a>
          even if you haven't finished all five lessons by that point
          &mdash; in this case, you may want to skim the remaining articles
          to get a flavor of what's covered.
          We will be very happy to hear your feedback after September 18,
          but we may not be able to incorporate your wonderful feedback into
          the summary of results from the study.
          (<span style="color:red;">UPDATE 09/22/15:</span>
          Please continue to submit surveys whenever you finish them.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks again for participating, we appreciate
          the time you are spending!
        </p>
        <h4>A Note About Anonymity</h4>
        <p>
          Rather than setting up a robust identification system, we have opted
          for a simple, self-reporting scheme based on an honor system: please
          pick a simple <b>ID Token</b> for yourself and enter it the same way
          in each of the surveys. This will allow us to correlate your responses
          throughout the tutorial. There is no registration process for ID
          tokens, so choose one as you see fit. You may decide to use your actual
          name as your token, or you may choose another moniker if you wish to
          remain anonymous. We ask only that you choose something that is likely
          to be unique. For example, "Bill" and "Sarah" are probably not good
          choices, but "BillAndSarahHeartSketchNSketchKThxBye" probably is
          &mdash; okay, well, maybe not anymore, but you get the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy sketching and sketching, Bill, Sarah, or whoever you are!
        </p>
