# Step 0: Entrance Survey

<br> Welcome to the Sketch-n-sketch Tutorial!

This tutorial is designed to teach you how to use the features of the
Sketch-n-Sketch tool. It is divided into 6 seperate lessons, each
designed to cover a few key topics. For each lesson, we have designed a set of
several excersises to be done in parallel using the the web version of
Sketch-n-sketch. We expect a lesson to take approximately 1-2 hours for a user
to complete - this may vary depending on your technical background.

In order to improve both the Sketch-n-sketch tool and this tutorial, we have
placed user survey questions across the following lessons. We have designed
these surveys to be quick, and interrupt the tutorial as little as possible. We
would greatly appreciate if you could take the occasional moment of your time to
fill them out.

#### A Note on Surveys & Anonymity

In order to correlate a user's experience across all of the lessons, we ask that
you create a simple **ID Token** for yourself. You may choose to use your actual
name for this token, or you may choose another moniker for your ID token if you
wish to remain anonymous. We only ask that you choose something relatively
unique (i.e. instead of using bill or sarah, consider adding an initial or some
numbers following your name).

#### Entrance Survey

For our first survey, we'd like to establish your ID token and get a general
idea of your technical background.
