# Step 1

Welcome to the first lesson for Sketch-n-Sketch! In this lesson, we you will:

* Learn how to use the Sketch-n-Sketch interface
* Recreate the Three Boxes example
* Create your own design of similar complexity

Let's get started.

<!--
What this first lesson will cover
* Basic functionality with Interface and first syntax features
* Recreating Three Boxes Example
* You will make your own example of similar complexity
-->

## The Interface

Sketch-n-Sketch is a tool that runs completely in the web browser. To start the
tool, you simply need to open a link to the tool in either Chrome or Firefox
[[Meta: We should test on Edge]]. The most recent release can be found
[here](http://ravichugh.github.io/sketch-n-sketch/releases/index.html)[[ and the
development version can be built from source on our project page
[here](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch)]]. After opening the tool,
you should see an interface with a variety of buttons and two main panes.
Graphics and Sketch-n-Sketch are created by writing code to generate the design,
which appears in the box on the right. The code is input in the box on the left.
You may only edit one of these two at a time, and the active pane is
highlighted. Between these two boxes there is a column of buttons as well as a
dropdown menu. The dropdown menu is used to load different examples and working
documents into your active editing environment. The Edit Code button turns into
the Run Code button when pressed, and it allows you to switch between which of
the two panes you are interacting with. The Save and Save As buttons work
similarly to how they work in desktop applications, and allow you to save your
work to be resumed during a different session. The Reload button reloads your
active document to the last save that was made. The Undo and Redo buttons allow
you to rewind the changes you made while manipulating the graphics with your
cursor. Finally, the [Zones] button allows you to switch between different means
of manipulation (more on that shortly). The [Out] button next to the graphics
canvas allows you to change the interface from rendering the output to
displaying the underlying SVG document that is generated. This allows you to
export your graphics by copying this text into a file on your local machine. Try
pressing all these buttons and seeing what happens. If you ever get to a state
where you're not sure what to do, simply reload the page and you will be
returned to the default state.

Loading and saving examples is straightforward, and can all be done with the
dropdown menu, the Save button, the Save As button, and the Reload button. To
load a new example, open the dropdown menu, scroll to the document that you
would like to open, and left click on it. If it is a built-in example, the code
of that document will fill the code pane and the rendered output associated with
it will fill the canvas pane. If it is a document that is not a built-in
example, only the code will be put into the code pane and it will not be
automatically run. After all, you may have saved a document that wasn't
complete, and so wouldn't compile! The \*Scratch\* example that you begin on
automatically remembers its contents as you work, so you may switch away from it
and then back and not worry about your work disappearing. However, in general,
you must save your work on any other document that you're working on before
navigating away, or you will lose the changes you've made. When you're on a
built-in example the changes you make can only be saved as a new document, as
you may not overwrite the contents of the built-in examples. When you're working
on a document that you have created, you may press the Save As button to save a
new copy under a different name or press the Save button to overwrite your
existing save. To clear all local saves that you have made, scroll down to the
bottom of the dropdown menu and press \*Clear Local Saves\*. Be careful, there's
no prompt to let you change your mind, and when they're gone they're gone for
good!

The interface also allows for a degree of customization. The interface can be
changed from a horizontal and vertical view by pressing the [Orientation] button
in the upper right corner of the window. Further, the relative sizes of the code
pane and the canvas pane can be changed by clicking and dragging the edges of
the middle button section. Whenever you save, your interface layout is also
saved for that document and is automatically set when you load that document. To
do these adjustments, you could also have used the arrow keys - go ahead and try
that now. For almost all of the actions that we've described, there also exists
a keyboard shortcut. It is by no means necessary, but if you would like to use
the keyboard shortcuts, a reference is provided below. From now on, I won't be
referring to pressing buttons or pressing keys, but only the intended action
associated with it.

Shortcuts available when the canvas pane is active:

| Keypresses   |   Meaning                                     |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `e`          |   Enter Edit Mode   						   |
| `z`          |   Undo 									   |
| `y`          |   Redo                                        |
| `g` or `h`   |   Toggle Zones                                |
| `o`          |   Toggle Output Type                          |
| `s`          |   Save                                        |
| `a`          |   Save As                                     |
| `p`          |   Switch Orientation                          |
| `Arrow Keys` |   Switches Orientation and Adjusts Pane Size  |

The only shortcut available when the code pane is active is `Alt+Shift`, which
runs the code. The code box provides its own keyboard shortcuts which depend on
your particular settings. If you are using the fancy code editor, however,
[this](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts) page
should be helpful.

## Writing in `little`

The language that you will be specifying your output in is called
`little`[^littlecomment]. It was created for Sketch-n-Sketch and should feel
familiar to anyone who has used a lisp-like language. If not, don't worry! The
syntax is very simple and should be able to be picked up without much trouble at
all. The output of a `little` program[^technicaloutput] is an [SVG
image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) that has a root
node of type `svg`. The general structure of most `little` programs is the
definition and calculation of everything you need for your graphic, followed by
a final statement that puts it all together.

[^littlecomment]: For those interested, a more technical syntax reference can be
found
[here](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/README.md).

[^technicaloutput]: Technically speaking, the
[output](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/src/Eval.elm#L48)
is of an [internal
type](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/src/Lang.elm#L77)
called `Val` that is then
[rendered](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/src/InterfaceView2.elm#L124)
to SVG, but it can be thought of as SVG, as it [mimics the structure of
SVG](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/src/LangSvg.elm#L360)
and mostly just carries additional metadata.

Functions in little are surrounded by mandatory parentheses; this includes
operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Lists are delimited with square brackets
and list elements are separated with whitespace. Comment lines begin with a
semicolon. Importantly, there may be no excess parentheses anywhere in the
program. To start getting a feel for the language, let's dive right in:

The simplest program that produces output is the following:

```
(svg [])
```

Go ahead and enter Edit Mode while on the \*Scratch\* example, delete the
contents, and type in the code above. Then, run the code. Congratulations,
you've just written your first `little` program! What you've specified is an SVG
node that has no shapes or children, and so your output is blank. As a blank
canvas is uninteresting, let's add some shapes.

To make shapes, you can use the built-in functions. To start, let's create a
rectangle using the `rect` function.

The `rect` function is of the form:

```
(rect color xpos ypos w h)
```

Where `xpos` and `ypos` specify the x-position and y-position of the top left
corner of the rectangle, respectively, `w` and `h` specify the width and height
of the rectangle, respectively, and `color` specifies the color of the shape.
`color` can come in the form of any color string recognized by
[CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colorsfull.asp), can be RGBA values in
a list, or can be a Color Number, the last of which will be addressed in the
next lesson. The position, width, and height values must be numbers. So, all of
the following are valid specifications for the same rectangle:

```
(rect 'Blue' 100 100 200 200)
(rect 'blue' 100.0 100.0 200.0 200.0)
(rect '#0000FF' (+ 50 50) 100 200 200)
(rect [0 0 255 1.0] 100 100.0 (/ 400 2) 200)
```

Enter Edit Mode, and place the rectangle into the empty `svg` definition that we
have from before, as below. Feel free to change the color or other parameters to
your liking.

```
(svg [(rect 'lightblue' 200 200 300 150)])
```

Now, run the program. There's your rectangle! Try experimenting with different
colors, positions, and sizes for your shape.

<!--
P1 
- The output of a little program is an SVG node of type 'svg' (or 'svgViewBox')
- The general structure of a little program is the definition and calculation of everything you need for your graphic, followed by a final statement that puts it all together

P2
- Functions in little are surrounded by parentheses that must always be there, and this includes operators like `+ - * /`

- Show how typing this in and hitting run works

P3
- A blank canvas is boring, let's put something on it!
- To make shapes, there are built in functions for simple shapes. Let's start with `rect`
  * `rect` has arguments `(rect color xpos ypos w h)`
- Now, add the rectangle to the canvas by putting it into the `svg` like so:
  * `(svg [(rect . . . . .)])`
- Hit run and see what you've got

## Helper Definitions, anonymous functions, and map

Adding shapes one at a time is difficult and inefficient for any more than a
handful of shapes, especially if the shapes share attributes in common. To aid
in this, we can create our own names for structures that we intend to reuse.
This is done with the help of the built-in functions `def` and `let`. The syntax
of `def` and `let` is as follows:

```
(def pattern patterndefinition) remainderofprogram
(let pattern patterndefinition remainderofscopefordefinition)
```

They are very similar, and differ only in their intended use; `def` is meant for
'top-level' definitions that will be used for the remainder of the program after
it, and `let` is meant for more localized definitions within a `def`. This
distinction will become clear as you become more familiar with the tool, for now
just remember that you cannot put a `def` inside of another `def`.

The `pattern` in the above definitions can either be a bare variable name or a
list of patterns, each of which can be a bare variable name or another list of
patterns. So, the following definitions all assign the values `10`, `20`, and
`30` to the names `x`, `y`, and `z`:

```
(def x 10)
(def y 20)
(def z 30)
```

```
(def [x y z] [10 20 30])
```

```
(def [[x y] z] [[10 20] 30])
```

```
(let x 10
(let y 20
(let z 30

; ...
; Rest of Program
; ...

)))
```

```
(let [x y z] [10 20 30]

; ...
; Rest of Program
; ...

)
```

Notice where the closing parentheses are for the definitions that use `let`.
Let's put these to use by giving a name to our rectangle, then using that
instead of the function when we put it in the `svg` function. One way we could
do this is as follows:

```
(def awesomeRectangle (rect 'lightblue' 100 100 150 100))
(svg [awesomeRectangle])
```

Much better than before! Try using `let` instead of `def` and notice the
difference[^defnote].

[^defnote]: To get a sense for why the `def` syntax was introduced, see the end
of
[this](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/6e3874b0b44e121dba8423d3b41b832cd8bb6429/src/Prelude.elm#L106)
old version of `prelude`, where there are a lot of functions in play.

Now, try putting more than one copy of our rectangle in `svg`, and running the
code. Even though there are multiple rectangles being output (which can be
verified by changing the output type to SVG), you can only see one. That is, of
course, because they're all in the same location and of the same size! To
distinguish multiple boxes on the screen, we need to vary the positions of some
of the boxes. This could be done by defining a new name for each box, but this
is very redundant if they share many attributes in common. A better way is to
define a function that, given a position, places a box with particular
attributes at that position. Then, we need only use the function and we avoid
needing to type the `rect` function repeatedly. To do this, we use what's called
an anonymous function using a backslash. The syntax for an anonymous function is
as follows:

```
(\argumentpattern expression)

or

(\(argumentpattern1 argumentpattern2 ... argumentpatternN) expression)
```

The arguments are each defined in terms of patterns and multiple arguments are
contained in parentheses and separated by spaces. The names for these arguments
can then be used in the following expression. For example, a function that takes
in variables `x` and `y` then returns their sum would be as follows:

```
(\(x y) (+ x y))
```

This is most helpful when combined with a `def` to give a name that can be used
with the function. So, to define a function `placeRectangle` that places a
rectangle at a given x-position, we could do the following:

```
(def placeRectangle (\xpos (rect 'lightBlue' xpos 100 150 100)))
```

Go ahead and define your own placement function for the rectangle that you named
before. Now, we can define our rectangle in terms of this function instead of
`rect` like we did before:

```
(def placeRectangle (\xpos (rect 'lightBlue' xpos 100 150 100)))
(def awesomeRectangle (placeRectangle 100))
(svg [awesomeRectangle])
```

Go ahead and do this for your rectangle.

You might be saying to yourself "Great, but this is worse than what I had before
for one rectangle!", and if so, you're right! However, this syntax lets you
define *many* rectangles when combined with the `map` function. The syntax for
`map` is as follows:

```
(map function list)
```

What `map` does is apply the function provided to the list to each element in
the list, and returns the list consisting of the results.[^justlikefp] So, we
can define a name that represents many rectangles and then use that instead of
writing a whole bunch of names. We could do this in the following manner:

[^justlikefp]: Just like in functional programming languages like Elm and
Haskell, and similarly to the `map` method in JavaScript.

```
(def placeRectangle (\\xpos (rect 'lightBlue' xpos 100 150 100)))
(def awesomeRectangles (map placeRectangle [100 300 500]))
(svg awesomeRectangles)
```

Now we have three rectangles instead of just one. Further, if we want to change
any of the shared attributes of the rectangles, like their color, we only need
to change *one definition* as opposed to three. Note that there is no longer the
list brackets around the argument to `svg`, as the output of `map` is already a
list. Go ahead and map your placement function over a list of locations and
adjust some of their shared parameters in the placement function.

<!--
P1
- Adding shapes one at a time is hard and inefficient if they share things in common.
- `def` and `let` are great for defining helper names; is just variable assignment
  * They are:
    * `(def pattern patterndefinition) remainderofprogram`
    * `(let pattern patterndefinition whereyouwouldliketousethedefinition)`
- Mention how `def` is only used at top level while `let` can be used for more local definitons
- Define a rectangle using def, then put the name in `svg`

P2
- Try putting more than one into `svg`. Can you tell why there's only one thing?
- If we want multiple near-identical boxes on the screen, we actually need to change some of the parameters of them. The position is the easiest thing. To do this, we can write a function that takes a position and puts a rectangle there. To do this, we need to use an anonymous function.
- Explain backslash with pattern and how it allows you to take in arguments
- Define `placeRectangle` that takes an x position and puts a rectangle there. Redefine your rectangle in terms of this function applied to a value.

P3
- Great, this looks worse than before for defining one rectangle! However, it lets you do lots of different rectangles when combined with a function called `map`.
- `map` takes a function and a list, and applies the function to all of the elements of the list.
- Define `manyRectangles` in terms of `placeRectangle` mapped over multiple x positions. Replace `(svg [ ... ])` with `(svg manyRectangles)`.

## Direct Manipulation

As you may have already tried, go ahead and try clicking and dragging the boxes
of the output after running the code and observing what happens to the input
source program. This final major component of Sketch-n-Sketch is directly
manipulating your output and is part of what makes this tool unique among
graphics editors. To see all of the ways you can manipulate your shape, change
what Zones are displayed and click and drag on each. Whenever you mouse over one
of the zones, the constants that will be changed by manipulating that zone are
highlighted in yellow in the source code. When manipulating that zone, the
constants that are being changed are highlighted in green. Constants that went
into the calculation of that attribute but will not be changed by your
manipulating them are highlighted in gray and constants for which changes could
not be deduced are highlighted in red (more on these last two in later lessons).

Different shapes come with different attributes that can be manipulated.
Redefine your `placeRectangle` function to place a circle instead, and then
examine the different zones that are available to you. As a reference for what
the `circle` function takes as arguments, switch to the `*Prelude*` example and
search (Ctl + f on most platforms) for 'circle'. Looking through Prelude is a
good idea for getting a sense of what functions are available to you to specify
shapes and perform other sorts of operations.

Beyond position and size for these shapes, color can also be manipulated. Go
ahead and change the Zones that are displayed to show the Color zone. For each
shape, there is a slider that represents a range of basic colors that can be
chosen for each shape. Try manipulating these for one of the shapes. When you do
this, you will see the color field in the definition of that shape change to a
number between zero and 500. This is a special designation for colors called a
Color Number[^colornum] and is meant to facilitate the direct manipulation of
color; when typing in your own colors you will likely use the string format or
the RGBA list format specified earlier.

[^colornum]: This is not a standard represenation for colors, and is defined
[here](https://github.com/ravichugh/sketch-n-sketch/blob/master/src/Utils.elm#L207).
Further investigation into implementation details for how constants are
substituted should quickly reveal why we chose one number to represent color in
this case.

Whew! You now should have a sense for how to specify your own shapes, names, and
functions. To further exercise your knowledge, go ahead and perform the
following tasks before proceeding to the next lesson:

- Change your placement function to take in the y-value of the shape instead of
  the x-value. This should result in your shapes being placed in a vertical line
  instead of a horizontal one.
- Change your program to display more than one row of shapes using any means you
  see fit.
- Change your placement function to take an x and a y position and use it to
  make a grid of shapes. Hint: The list the function is mapped over can take the
  form `[[100 100] [200 100] ... ]`.

<!--
P1
- We now have recreated the three boxes example. As you may have already tried, go ahead and, after hitting `Run Code`, clicking and dragging various some of the rectangles.
- To see all the different parts of the rectangles that you can manipulate, go ahead and hit the Zones button
- There's different colors that appear; explain what they mean

P2
- Different shapes have different attributes that can be manipulated. Redefine your `placeRectangles` function to be a circle.
- Manipulate the radius and position of the circles.
- Other attributes can also be manipulated directly, like color. Go ahead and switch the zones to the one that has color, and play with it there.
- You will notice that your color string has been replaced with a single number; explain what this is.

P3
- Exercise time!
- Change your example to vary the y value instead of the x
- Change your example to display more than one row of shapes using any means you see fit
- Change your example function to take an x and a y position and make a grid of shapes
  * Hint about how the input will look like `[[100 100] [200 100] ... ]`
