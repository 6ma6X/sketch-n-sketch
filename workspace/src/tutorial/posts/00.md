# Step 1

What this first lesson will cover
* Basic functionality with Interface and first syntax features
* Recreating Three Boxes Example
* You will make your own example of similar complexity

## The Interface

P1
- How to get going (opening up the web page)
- The window has two panes, what they do
- What the middle buttons do and are for

P2 - Loading, saving, Save As, and clearing saves

P3 - Changing the pane width and orientation

## Writing in `little`

P1 
- The output of a little program is an SVG node of type 'svg' (or 'svgViewBox')
- The general structure of a little program is the definition and calculation of everything you need for your graphic, followed by a final statement that puts it all together

P2
- Functions in little are surrounded by parentheses that must always be there, and this includes operators like `+ - * /`
- The simplest program that produces output in little is `(svg [])`
- Show how typing this in and hitting run works

P3
- A blank canvas is boring, let's put somthing on it!
- To make shapes, there are built in functions for simple shapes. Let's start with `rect`
  * `rect` has arguments `(rect color xpos ypos w h)`
- Now, add the rectangle to the canvas by putting it into the `svg` like so:
  * `(svg [(rect . . . . .)])`
- Hit run and see what you've got

## Helper Definitions, anonymous functions, and map

P1
- Adding shapes one at a time is hard and inefficient if they share things in common.
- `def` and `let` are great for defining helper names; is just variable assignment
  * They are:
    * `(def pattern patterndefinition) remainderofprogram`
    * `(let pattern patterndefinition whereyouwouldliketousethedefinition)`
- Mention how `def` is only used at top level while `let` can be used for more local definitons
- Define a rectangle using def, then put the name in `svg`

P2
- Try putting more than one into `svg`. Can you tell why there's only one thing?
- If we want multiple near-identical boxes on the screen, we actually need to change some of the parameters of them. The position is the easiest thing. To do this, we can write a function that takes a position and puts a rectangle there. To do this, we need to use an anonymous function.
- Explain backslash with pattern and how it allows you to take in arguments
- Define `placeRectangle` that takes an x position and puts a rectangle there. Redefine your rectangle in terms of this function applied to a value.

P3
- Great, this looks worse than before for defining one rectangle! However, it lets you do lots of different rectangles when combined with a function called `map`.
- `map` takes a function and a list, and applies the function to all of the elements of the list.
- Define `manyRectangles` in terms of `placeRectangle` mapped over multiple x positions. Replace `(svg [ ... ])` with `(svg manyRectangles)`.

## Direct Manipulation

P1
- We now have recreated the three boxes example. As you may have already tried, go ahead and, after hitting `Run Code`, clicking and dragging various some of the rectangles.
- To see all the different parts of the rectangles that you can manipulate, go ahead and hit the Zones button
- There's different colors that appear; explain what they mean

P2
- Different shapes have different attributes that can be manipulated. Redefine your `placeRectangles` function to be a circle.
- Manipulate the radius and position of the circles.
- Other attributes can also be manipulated directly, like color. Go ahead and switch the zones to the one that has color, and play with it there.
- You will notice that your color string has been replaced with a single number; explain what this is.

P3
- Exercise time!
- Change your example to vary the y value instead of the x
- Change your example to display more than one row of shapes using any means you see fit
- Change your example function to take an x and a y position and make a grid of shapes
  * Hint about how the input will look like `[[100 100] [200 100] ... ]`
