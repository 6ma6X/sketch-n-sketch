# Step 4

Welcome to the fourth lesson in the Sketch-n-Sketch tutorial. In this tutorial,
we will cover:

- How to use the `line` function to make simple line segments
- How to use the `path` function to create arbitrary forms
- How to introduce parameters into the `path` function as a useful design
    pattern
- How to generate paths to make up a design

Let's dive in!

<!--
What we will cover in this lesson:

- How to use `line`
- Understand how `path` works, and the particular concerns that come with it.

Key aspects to `path`:

That it's a list of movement commands in basically the same fashion that the
normal SVG path is specified.

How to read the documentation for all the different curve types and such.
(www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html

Paths start withe a `moveto`, usually ends with a `closepath` (for closed
shapes, not for open ones). In between are either `lineto` or curve commands.

They allow for the creation of any shape, and most designs will probably end up
incorporating them in some fashion. In Sketch-n-Sketch, they end up being used
in a few ways, each with their own attributes:
-->

## Using `line` and `case`

So far, the only basic shape that we have not covered is creating finite line
segments. Just like the other basic shapes, there is a built-in function that
allows the creation of the appropriate SVG node called, naturally, `line`:

```
(line fill w x1 y1 x2 y2)
```

This creates a line from the point `(x1,y1)` to `(x2,y2)` with the color `fill`
and width `w`. This function works very well for making very simple line
segments between shapes, and can be used to approximate a rotated rectangle if
the width is set particularly wide, as the endcaps of the line are rectangular
and there is no limit on how wide the line segment can be. To draw a polygon,
you could link these line segments together one at a time around the perimeter
of the shape. In fact, let's do just that.

Our goal is to get a function that, given a list of points `[x y]`, creates an
empty polygon that draws line segments between all the adjacent points. To do
this, we will need to introduce syntax that allows us to operate on lists
differently depending on if they happen to be empty or not. The function in
question is called `case` and takes arguments in a slightly different way than
other functions:

```
(case parameterToCheckAgainst
  (pattern1 returnIfPattern1Matches)
  (pattern2 returnIfPattern2Matches)
  ...
  (_ returnIfNoOtherPatternsMatch) )
```

The newlines between the cases are optional, but helps readibility greatly. The
notion is that if `parameterToCheckAgainst` matches one of the patterns, then
the expression that is associated with that pattern is returned. The patterns
are checked from the top down, and an underscore `_` matches anything. As an
example, here is a case statement, some example inputs, and which pattern gets
matched:

```
(case inputList
  ([]               ...) ; pattern 1
  ([x]              ...) ; pattern 2
  ([x y]            ...) ; pattern 3
  ([x]              ...) ; pattern 4
  ([ [a b] | rest ] ...) ; pattern 5
  (_                ...) ; pattern 6

[] matches pattern 1
[ 2 ] matches pattern 2, and not pattern 4
[ 1 2 3 ] matches pattern 6
[ [ 2 4 ] ] matches pattern 5
[ [ 2 3 4 ] ] matches pattern 6
'string' matches pattern 6
5 matches pattern 6
```

Since `little` does not enforce any type constraints, the catchall `_` could
catch some inputs that you would not like to attempt to operate on at all, so be
careful with it! A very common pattern is to use `case` in recursive functions
to define a base case and a recursive case for operating on lists. So, to define
our own version of `concat`, we could do the following:

```
(defrec ourConcat (\list (case list
    ([] [])
    ([ [] | rest ] (ourConcat rest))
    ([ [ x | xs ] | rest ] [x | (ourConcat [ xs | rest ])]) ) ) )
```

Notice that we combined `case` with an anonymouse function to make it such that
we could take in a list, and that we used `defrec` instead of `def` here, as we
recursively call `ourConcat` inside of `ourConcat`. 
Further, if we input anything that is not a list of
lists, then our program will fail at runtime. This is a very standard definition
of a recursive concatenation, and will likely look familiar to you (albeit with
a different syntax than you're used to).

Knowing how to write functions that operate on lists, we can now write our
function to create a polygon from a list of points. Our approach will be to call
`line` for each pairwise set of points as well as the first and last points.
Doing this, we could write:

<!-- TODO check this to make sure it works -->
```
(def [linecolor linewd] ['black' 10])
(defrec ourPolygon_ (\(points [ firstx firsty ]) (case points
  ([ [lastx lasty ] [ (line linecolor linewd firstx firsty lastx lasty ) ])
  ([ [x1 y1] [x2 y2] | rest ] [ (line linecolor linewd x1 y1 x2 y2) [x2 y2] | rest] ) ) ) )
(def ourPolygon (\points (case points
  ([] [])
  ([ onlyOne ] [])
  ([ first | rest ]  (ourPolygon_ points first)) ) ) )
```

Awesome! Our function `ourPolygon` handles preparing the arguments for the
second function, `ourPolygon_`, which then operates recursively on the elements
of the points list. Go ahead and enter this into a document in Sketch-n-Sketch
and enter some points to see it in action.

To get you really comfortable with this syntax, go ahead and perform the
following exercise: [[ Rephrase this ]]

* As it is, entering the list `[ [ 10 10 ] [ 50 50 ] ]` into `ourPolygon`
    draws two near-identical line segments. Add an additional case in
    `ourPolygon_` to make it such that only one line segment is drawn.
* (Optional) Redefine `ourPolygon` to use `foldr` instead.

## Basic Path Commands

After defining some key values, defining the entirety of a shape in terms of
those parameters (see Botanic Garden, Eye Icon). This is akin to hard-coding
most of the shapes in a design. Sometimes it's necessary (the design just
inherently has a lot of parameters), but it's good to think about if you're in
that situation or if you can design your program in such a fashion that it's
more composable/extensible.
Pros: 
    Entire path is visible in the code at once
    Each point is easily manipulated
Cons:
    Many variables end up being in play (but, sometimes this in unavoidable)
Remember:
    You're in for a lot of entry of numbers by hand in this case. Sometimes it's
    the only way it can be done, but usually it can benefit from simplification
    according to the next method.

## Parameters in Paths

After defining some shared parameter, defining the entirety of a shape in terms
of that parameter with some modifier for each point (see Active Trans,
Haskell.org, POP-PL Logo, Wikimedia Logo). Between the three, this seems to be a
good sweet spot of complexity and utility.
Pros:
    Fewer variables are in play than previously
    Each point is easily manipulated
    Manipulating groups of points is drastically easier
Cons:
    More complex than previously, manipulating one point manipulates many
Remember:
    This is a big improvement over hard-coding most everything if there are a
    small number of parameters that affect a lot of the points, and there is
    hardly a design that cannot benefit from this simplification.

## Generating Paths

After defining a few parameters, *generating* paths to make up a design (see Pie
Chart, Sailboat). This usually only comes up in certain types of designs - this
is not an applicable design pattern for all usages of `path` by any means - but
it lets you manipulate SVG images in a way that is impossible without a means of
programmatically specifying designs.
Pros:
    Allows a dynamic design editing process that is otherwise impossible
    Code is typically drastically more concise than the other two methods
Cons:
    Significantly more complex than either of the previous two methods, leading
    to a more involved write/debug process that usually includes head-scratching
    around how exactly edge cases in SVG paths work
    The whole path is not in view anywhere in the code, making small
    single-picture-location edits much more difficult/impossible
Remember:
    Need to tack on the initial 'M' separately from the generating function
    (usually)
    'Z' creates a subpath and draws a line to connect the end to the start
