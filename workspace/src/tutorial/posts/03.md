# Step 4

What we will cover in this lesson:

- How to use `line`
- Understand how `path` works, and the particular concerns that come with it.

Key aspects to `path`:

That it's a list of movement commands in basically the same fashion that the
normal SVG path is specified.

How to read the documentation for all the different curve types and such.
(www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html

Paths start withe a `moveto`, usually ends with a `closepath` (for closed
shapes, not for open ones). In between are either `lineto` or curve commands.

They allow for the creation of any shape, and most designs will probably end up
incorporating them in some fashion. In Sketch-n-Sketch, they end up being used
in a few ways, each with their own attributes:

After defining some key values, defining the entirety of a shape in terms of
those parameters (see Botanic Garden, Eye Icon). This is akin to hard-coding
most of the shapes in a design. Sometimes it's necessary (the design just
inherently has a lot of parameters), but it's good to think about if you're in
that situation or if you can design your program in such a fashion that it's
more composable/extensible.
Pros: 
    Entire path is visible in the code at once
    Each point is easily manipulated
Cons:
    Many variables end up being in play (but, sometimes this in unavoidable)
Remember:
    You're in for a lot of entry of numbers by hand in this case. Sometimes it's
    the only way it can be done, but usually it can benefit from simplification
    according to the next method.

After defining some shared parameter, defining the entirety of a shape in terms
of that parameter with some modifier for each point (see Active Trans,
Haskell.org, POP-PL Logo, Wikimedia Logo). Between the three, this seems to be a
good sweet spot of complexity and utility.
Pros:
    Fewer variables are in play than previously
    Each point is easily manipulated
    Manipulating groups of points is drastically easier
Cons:
    More complex than previously, manipulating one point manipulates many
Remember:
    This is a big improvement over hard-coding most everything if there are a
    small number of parameters that affect a lot of the points, and there is
    hardly a design that cannot benefit from this simplification.

After defining a few parameters, *generating* paths to make up a design (see Pie
Chart, Sailboat). This usually only comes up in certain types of designs - this
is not an applicable design pattern for all usages of `path` by any means - but
it lets you manipulate SVG images in a way that is impossible without a means of
programmatically specifying designs.
Pros:
    Allows a dynamic design editing process that is otherwise impossible
    Code is typically drastically more concise than the other two methods
Cons:
    Significantly more complex than either of the previous two methods, leading
    to a more involved write/debug process that usually includes head-scratching
    around how exactly edge cases in SVG paths work
    The whole path is not in view anywhere in the code, making small
    single-picture-location edits much more difficult/impossible
Remember:
    Need to tack on the initial 'M' separately from the generating function
    (usually)
    'Z' creates a subpath and draws a line to connect the end to the start
