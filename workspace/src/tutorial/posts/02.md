# Step 2: Constant vs. Computed Attributes

<br>
In this lesson, we will cover:

- How to program and directly manipulate "computed" attributes,
- How to control what parameters may and may not be directly manipulated, and
- How to employ the Group Box pattern.

### Two Kinds of Parameters

When programming designs in Little, there are two primary ways to define
attributes of a shape: the first is by specifying a constant expression (for
example, using a number `3.14` or a variable `pie` that stores a number), and the
second is by specifying an expression that computes a value (such as `(/ pie 2)`).
In the first lesson, all of the attributes of our rectangles were constant
expressions. As such, manipulating any one of their attributes in the canvas
led to a single, straightforward change to the input program, namely, a change
to the appropriate constant expression in the program. When manipulating a
computed expression, however, there are multiple constants in the program that
"contribute" to the final value, so it's not immediately clear what the user
intends and, thus, what Sketch-n-Sketch should do.

The best way to explain some of the challenges is to work through an example.
Let's pick up with the three rectangles example from the first lesson. Start by
reloading the final program (or, to test your Little skills, rewrite it from
scratch).

Now, recall that we defined the x-position of each box so that they were evenly
spaced. We defined these positions using hard-coded constant expressions. This
isn't so great, however, because if we want to change the separation factor, we
would have to manually recompute and change the x-positions of multiple
shapes &mdash; remember that really annoying part of Exercise 1.1?
Instead, let's rewrite our program to *compute* the x-positions based on the
desired start position and spacing.

**Practice 2.1:** To make this change, define two variables at the start of your
program `x0` and `xSep`. As a reminder, you can define variables using the `def`
syntax as below. Remember that you need to define any variables before you use
them in your program, so make sure that this definition comes before any other
statements in your program.

```
(def [x0 xSep] [100 150])
```

Next, redefine your `placeRectangle` function to take the "index" instead of the
box (that is, the `0`th box, `1`st box, `2`nd box, and so on) rather than its
x-position. Using this indexing scheme, the x-position of a the `index`-th box
will be determined by the expression `(+ x0 (* xSep index))`.

Finally, redefine the SVG canvas to map the `placeRectangle` function over a
list of indices instead of x-positions. Start with index `0` so that the first
rectangle is placed exactly at position `x0`. After doing this, run the program
and examine your output. Feel free to manipulate the shapes a bit to get them
all in view, and to change the list of indices to add or remove boxes from the
design.

#### Directly Manipulating Computed Values

Let's now take a closer look at how Sketch-n-Sketch decides how to update the
program when one of the boxes is directly manipulated. Notice that all of the
x-positions are determined by the same expression `(+ x0 (* xSep index))`, and
that different values of `index` lead to different resulting values. For the
`0`th box, the x-position is completely determined by `x0` because `(* xSep 0)`
is equal to `0`. Therefore, when you directly manipulate the position of this
box, Sketch-n-Sketch has no choice but to change the value stored in the `x0`
variable.

For each of the remaining boxes, however, there are three constants in the
program that contribute its x-position: `x0`, `xSep`, and `index`. For example,
when dragging the second box from an initial x-position, say `250`, to a
new position, say `400`, there are many different changes to `x0`, `xSep`, and
`index` (infinitely many, the realities of floating-point arithmetic notwithstanding)
such that the result of the expression `(+ x0 (* xSep index))` is `400`.

So, what is Sketch-n-Sketch to do in the face of such ambiguity? One option is
to "pause" and explicitly ask you, the user, what kinds of changes to the
program you want in response to dragging each box. This would really hinder the
interactivity and utility of our tool.

<p>Instead, our design automatically chooses which constants in the program to
change using some simple heuristics (described in this [technical
report][techrep] if you're curious) without asking for the user's help. To
explain these choices, when the user hovers over a zone for a particular shape,
Sketch-n-Sketch highlights the parts of the program that will change in response
to direct manipulation (recall the
<span class="hoverGreen">green</span>,
<span class="hoverYellow">yellow</span>,
<span class="hoverRed">red</span>,
<span class="hoverGray">gray</span>
discussion from the first article).</p>

**Practice 2.2:** Try directly manipulating various zones of the different rectangles and see what
happens. Sometimes the program update that Sketch-n-Sketch infers to match your
changes to the canvas may not be exactly what you want. Oops, sorry about that!
Our hope, however, is that the default choices are often useful, and that the
benefits of the immediate interactivity outweighs the drawbacks of sometimes
getting program updates that you didn't want. In the latter case, remember that
you can also Undo your most recent actions. In the next section, we'll also
describe a way to exert some control over the choices that Sketch-n-Sketch
makes.

**Exercise 2.1:** Now is a good time to pause and experiment a bit on your own. Try modifying
the Little program to compute other attributes of the boxes. One possibility is
to add a `ySep` parameter to vary the y-position of the shapes depending on the
index. Another possibility is to define some sort of `scale` factor and use it
to vary the width and height of the boxes.


### Freezing and Thawing Constants

By default, Sketch-n-Sketch may change the values of all numeric constants in
your Little program to help reconcile the changes you make via direct
manipulation. You may find that there are numbers in your program that you do
not want to be changed no matter what happens in the canvas pane.  You can
instruct Sketch-n-Sketch not to change a number by "freezing" it, indicated with
a bang (`!`). We say that a number is "thawed" if it is not frozen. Only thawed
numbers may be modified via direct manipulation.

For example, try modifying the variable definitions as follows:

```
(def [x0 xSep] [100 150!])
```

As a result, Sketch-n-Sketch may modify the value of `x0` but not `xSep`. Try
directly manipulating  the boxes to see what happens. Also try freezing `x0` and
unfreezing `xSep`.

You may have noticed that manipulating certain rectangles actually changes the
`index` values. Although when writing the program, you may have a clear sense
that indices ought not to change, in general, these are perfectly plausible
values to change to reconcile updates to the canvas, so sometimes
Sketch-n-Sketch will choose to modify them. In cases like this, you can freeze
the particular constants to declare your intent.
If you structure part of your design around the

```
(map drawingFunction indices)
```

pattern, it is often a good idea to freeze all of these indices.
Try freezing all of the indices above and, again, see what happens when you
directly manipulate different boxes.

By default, all numbers not explicitly annotated as frozen are treated as
thawed. Sometimes, however, you may want the default to be reversed; that is,
you may want Sketch-n-Sketch to treat all numbers as frozen unless explicitly
thawed. This is particularly desirable when you have lots of constants in your
program, or when your design is "mature" and you only want to be make small
changes via direct manipulation. There's an option you can declare at the
beginning of your program if you would like this behavior instead. If you would
like to see how this works, take a look at the built-in example called
Thaw/Freeze in the dropdown menu. (Don't forget to hit Save before you switch
examples!)

<img align="right" width="350px" style="padding: 0 0px 0 20px;"
     src="""@root/static/images/tutorial/02/logo-twice.png"""/>

**Exercise 2.2:** Take a look at the built-in Logo example, which is our logo for
Sketch-n-Sketch born and raised using our tool. Try directly manipulating
various attributes of the design, freezing and thawing constants as desired.
Once you are comfortable, modify the program so that it draws the logo twice
side-by-side separated by a distance of `delta` pixels. Structure your changes
so that you can still directly manipulate the `delta` parameter with ease. Also,
try to set things up so that you can directly manipulate the height and width of
the entire "double logo" design. (Hint: if you get stuck on this last bit, keep
reading below.)

### Group Box Pattern

Perhaps suprisingly, one of the parameters that ends up being computed in many
designs is the overall width and height of the graphic. In cases where the
ability to change the overall width and height is desirable, a useful design
pattern to employ is a "group box." The idea behind a group box is to define at
least two parameters that represent the width and height of the design and then
have an "invisible" box behind the visible portion of the graphic that allows
you to manipulate them. Then, you define the rest of your graphic in terms of
this width and height, making it such that changes to the overall width and
height will scale the rest of your graphic appropriately. In addition to these
width and height parameters, it can be useful to define an x-offset and y-offset
parameter as well, which allows for the translation of the entire design.

<img align="right" width="350px" style="padding: 0 0px 0 20px;"
     src="""@root/static/images/tutorial/02/chicago-flag.png"""/>

One such example that benefits from this is a flag, as it is a design that often
needs to be translated and scaled when used in other graphics. Since we're based
out of Chicago, we'll step through how to define and manipulate the Flag of Chicago
using Sketch-n-Sketch. Along the way, we'll practice using our skills freezing
constants, in addition to the basics we learned last lesson.

Although it is often helpful to define a group box first, you may sometimes
realize that you want one only after you've developed parts of your design. No
matter, you can always go back and refactor your design so that the attributes
of your shapes derive from the overall height, width, and position attributes of
the group box.

**Practice 2.3:** Let's define initial width, height, x-, and y-position values that will be used
to position and proportion our box. Then, define a group box that has position
and dimension exactly equal to those values. An important aspect of a group box
is that it should not affect the final image, so defining its color with an RGBA
value with an alpha-component of zero is a good idea. Putting these together, we
have the following:

```
(def [x0 y0 w h] [66 66 450 300])
(def groupBox
  (let [deltaP deltaS] [10! 20!]
  (rect [255 255 255 0]
        (- x0 deltaP) (- y0 deltaP)
        (+ w deltaS) (+ h deltaS))))
```

Here, `deltaP` and `deltaS` represent the difference between the positioning
(both `x0` and `y0`) and the sizing (both `w` and `h`) of the group box and its
contents. Think of this as a layer of padding that allows for easier
manipulation of the dimensions and positioning without accidentally grabbing an
interior shape. This issue is more prevalent in more crowded designs, as can be seen
in the built-in examples US-13 Flag and US-50 Flag. Notice that, as a matter of
style, we've chosen to use a `let` inside the `groupBox` definition &mdash; rather
than a `def` outside of it &mdash; for these variables since we will not need
them anywhere else later in the program.

Once you've defined this, put your `groupBox` into an `svg` definition at the
end of your program, turn on [Zones] Basic, and resize it to
your liking. Now, all the graphics you define should go inside the boundaries of
this box and have their proportions tied to the size and position of the group
box.

It's important to remember that the shapes shouldn't completely overlap the
zones for the manipulation of the group box, otherwise you will not be able to
adjust those parameters. For instance, the blue stripes (the CSS color
`'lightblue'` is a close enough match for our purposes) should be positioned
such that you can still manipulate the underlying group box. So, the following
definition is one way to define the stripes (keeping in mind, of course, the
[official proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Chicago)):

```
(def stripes
  [ (rect 'lightblue' x0 (+ y0 (/ h 7!)) w (/ h 6!))
    (rect 'lightblue' x0 (+ y0 (* 5! (/ h 7!))) w (/ h 6!)) ])
```

Note that we've frozen all of the constants that we use to do the proportioning
of the shapes, since we don't want to accidentally directly manipulate them later.

**Exercise 2.3 (Optional):** Refactor the `stripes` definition with additional
variables (using `let`-expressions) to eliminate redundant calculations.

**Practice 2.4:** Next, we need to define the six-pointed stars that run horizontally across the
middle of the design. Programming a six-pointed star is an interesting
exercise in its own right, but it's a common enough shape that we've made a
built-in function to generate n-pointed stars, `nStar` (If you're interested in
how it's implemented, check out the Stars example or the
[Prelude][PreludeSource]. The `nStar` function takes
arguments of the following form:

```
(nStar fill stroke w n len1 len2 rot cx cy)
```

The arguments to `nStar` define the following:

* *`fill`* is the color of the fill of the star 
* *`stroke`* is the color of the outline of the star (`'none'` is an acceptable and commonly used value)
* *`w`* is the width of the outline
* *`n`* is the number of points on the star
* *`len1`* is the length from the center of the star to the outer points
* *`len2`* is the length from the center of the star to the inner points 
* *`rot`* is the amount of clockwise rotation in radians
* *`cx`* is the x-position of the center of the star
* *`cy`* is the y-position of the center of the star

To define a six-pointed star with the appropriate color and
dimensions, we could write the following:

```
(def placeStar (\i
  (let xi (+ x0 (* i (/ w 4!)))
  (nStar 'red' 'none' 0! 6! (/ h 10!) (/ h 25!) 0! xi (+ y0 (/ h 2!))))))
```

Then, we can define all of our stars as follows:

```
(def stars (map placeStar [0.5! 1.5! 2.5! 3.5!]))
```

Add these stars to the overall `svg` canvas &mdash; via `(append [groupBox]
(append stars stripes))` or, equivalently, `(concat [groupBox] stars stripes)`
&mdash; and out comes our flag! All that work to incorporate the overall width and
height of the image now pays off, as we can translate and scale the whole design
and not have to worry about fixing the proportionality by hand. 

<img align="right" width="150px" style="padding: 20px 0px 0 20px;"
     src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Flag_of_Sealand.svg/1480px-Flag_of_Sealand.svg.png"/>

**Exercise 2.4:** Now that you have some experience with computed attributes and the
group box pattern, it's your turn to run wild! Pick the flag of a country or
city (ideally, not one that is already in the examples) and recreate it. Be sure
to use a group box to be able to adjust the overall size and position.
You'll probably want to choose a flag that consists mostly of simple shapes for now,
because we haven't talked about polygons or curved lines yet.
But if you cannot bear the anticipation, you can look at [Prelude][PreludeSource] to
see how lines and polygons are drawn. If you do, then one enjoyable option may be to
tackle the [flag of Sealand][SealandFlag] while listening to
[this podcast][SealandPodcast].
