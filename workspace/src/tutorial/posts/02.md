# Step 3

What this third lesson will cover
- UI Widgets for manipulation of indirect parameters that have no direct representation

That's a big and somewhat complicated topic, so we'll be spending the whole section on it.

## Motivating UI Widgets

P1
- There's some things you just can't manipulate directly. Whether or not you believe me, we're going to go through an example of that now.
- Develop an example where we place squares in a circle. Along the way introduce trig functions and `range`.
- Now, even though the number of boxes that are placed equally spaced along the circle is a parameter of the image, there's no way to directly manipulate it. (Well, there is, but there's no *nice* way to do it).

P2
- In such a situation, it would still be really nice to be able to directly manipulate the number of squares. Enter UI Widgets.
- The principle behind UI Widgets is that you define a helper object that you don't intend to be in the final output that has a directly manipulable property that is linked to the indirect parameter that we can't otherwise manipulate.
- To illustrate the point, add one more box to your image that is defined in the following way:
  * `(square color(!) (+ new_x_0 (* 100! numboxes)) new_y_0(!) new_side_length(!))`
- Manipulating the x position of this box will change the `numboxes` parameter. So, you can now directly manipulate the number of boxes, an indirect parameter.

P3
- We can do better than just bare boxes; look at hSlider, vertical sliders, and xySliders
- Go over how to drop these into your program, and how to structure them to manipulate particular parameters

P4(?)
- Explain how `line` works(?)
- Explain how `concat` works(?)
- Could use the Ferris Wheel example to do this.

## Free Form Example, Complex enough to warrant UI Widgets, Reinforces what we've already learned

P1
- Your turn again!
- Time to design something a bit bigger. Do the following things (in order would probably be easiest):
  * Choose an overall design that you would like to create. It should involve at least three kinds of shapes.
  * Choose a subset of the design that is all of one shape and where the elements are logically linked to one another (e.g. the cars in the Ferris Wheel example). Write a placement function and map it over a list of indices (or a list of some parameter) to generate that subset.
  * If possible, reduce that list of indices or parameters to something that is determined according to only one or two variables. `range` comes in handy here, and mapping a `generateParameter` function over something generated by range is also good.
  * Now, make a UI Widget to manipulate this parameter or these parameters.
  * Pick the next subset of the design, and repeat.
  * Go until you've completed the design. Feel free to 'turn off' the UI Widgets that you don't want anymore as well as freeze parameters that you feel good about.
- Suggested projects: 
  * A much more full-featured color picker (RGBA, brightness, etc.)
  * A city or country flag that has many repeated elements
  * A simple picture of a house, like [this](http://www.sbccaofmn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/house-clipart.gif).
