# Step 5: Additional SVG Functionality

<br> In the previous several lessons, we have discussed SVG features that have
some "special" support from Sketch-n-Sketch. In this lesson, we will cover:

- How to use Little's "thin wrapper" around the full range of SVG
  nodes and attributes.

Let's get going!

<!--
This lesson will focus on using the thin wrapper syntax in `little` to interface
directly with the underlying SVG output to create SVG nodes and attributes that
aren't a part of built-in functionality. Excited? Let's get going!

<!--
What we will cover in this lesson:

- How to use the thin wrapper syntax to define SVG nodes that aren't built in

Cover how `svgViewBox` works
Go into detail about the `['nodeType' [attrs] [children]]` structure works

We need to use Prelude as an example for this; good examples are the defs for:

circle
ellipse
rect
line
polygon
polyline
path
text

Talking about addAttr is probably a good thing as well, as it simplifies some of
the function definitions tha do complicated things.

This lesson will focus on the implementation of a something that isn't currently
part of built-in functionality, after reimplementing something that is. So:

* Reimplement a shape or shapes
* Pick an SVG node type (anything from
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/SVG/Element works, especially
  something unusual like feTurbulence) and implement it
* Focus on how to structure this as a function that is reusable so that you can
  use it in your later designs
* Ask the user to impelement an element that looks cool to them. It's okay to
  reimplement one that we have already (so long as you don't peek!)
-->

### Thin Wrapper Syntax

As mentioned in the first lesson, the output of a Little program is an SVG node that
has type `svg`. However, while SVG nodes are represented in text form as XML-
style nodes and attributes delimited with `<` and `>`, SVG nodes in Little are
represented by three-element lists of the following form:

```
[ 'nodeName' attributeList childNodeList ]
```

Furthermore, each attribute takes the form

```
[ 'attrName' value ]
```

where the `value` can be a string, number, or list depending on what `attrName`
is. No matter what, however, a string `value` can be used, in which case it is
translated copied directly into the output SVG format. For this reason, we
describe our representation of SVG elements as a "thin wrapper" around the full
specification, because you can always just use strings. (The benefit of using
numbers, lists, etc. whenever possible, however, is that Sketch-n-Sketch editor
can provide interactive direct manipulation when these values are not "buried"
inside strings.) The `nodeName` value above can also be any string and, along with
the attributes, will simply be dropped as-is into the SVG output.

Having let the cat out of the bag, we can now think about how to reimplement the
`rect` function ourselves. In raw SVG format, a rectangle is specified in the
following fashion:

```
<rect x="xval" y="yval" width="widthval" height="heightval" fill="colorname">
	... Usually no children ...
</rect>
```

Usually, a rectangle has no children, so we may leave the children list empty.
Furthermore, the attributes that are absolutely necessary are `x`, `y`, `width`,
`height`, and `fill`. So, we should make those arguments to our function. Thus,
we can specify the following Little function to make a rectangle:

```
(def ourRect (\(x y w h fill)
  [ 'rect' 
    [ ['x' x]
      ['y' y]
      ['width' w]
      ['height' h]
      ['fill' fill]
    ]
    []
  ] ) )
```

It can be hard to read and write code with these lists of lists everywhere, so
sometimes it helps to introduce temporary variables:

```
(def ourRect (\(x y w h fill)
  (let attrs [['x' x] ['y' y] ['width' w] ['height' h] ['fill' fill]]
  (let children []
    ['rect' attrs children]))))
```

That's pretty much all there is to the built-in `rect` function. All of the
shape functions in Little are implemented in similar fashion. Take a peek at
[Prelude][PreludeSource] to see how the functions `line`, `rect`, `circle`,
`path`, and so on simply provide a nicer syntax than having to write down lists
of lists all over the place.

<!--
This doesn't match the syntax for the actual implementation exactly (which can
be found in prelude, if you haven't already peeked), but it allows for exactly
the same functionality as the built-in `rect`.
-->

The Prelude functions are defined to take as arguments the most common
attributes for each kind of shape. But because SVG elements are really
represented using the aforementioned three-element list encoding under the hood,
there's nothing stopping you for specifying additional attributes.
For example, as mentioned on the
[documentation page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect) for `rect`, another common usage is to specify a
rectangle with rounded corners.

**Exercise:** Modify `ourRect` so that it allows you to specify the radius of
the rounded corners.

There's a nice helper function in [Prelude][PreludeSource] called `addAttr`
that can be very helpful for creating complicated SVG nodes. Its definition
is as follows:

```
(def addAttr (\([shapeKind oldAttrs children] newAttr)
  [shapeKind (snoc newAttr oldAttrs) children]))
```

This allows attributes to be appended to existing SVG nodes with
ease.[^designchoice] It is easy to imagine a similar function that allows for
the appending of children as well. Furthermore, as attributes and children are just
lists with elements that are straightforward to pattern match on with `case`,
there's plenty of functionality for any function to modify any shape in any way.
To illustrate the functionality, let's create a function that sets the `fill`
attribute of an SVG node if it isn't there and changes it to the given value if
it is:

[^designchoice]: Currently, we've stuck with the design decision to have the
built-in functionality lend itself towards a single statement that creates the
SVG node for a given shape or other structure after which that node isn't
manipulated any further. There's no reason why things need to be done this way
and it's simply how we chose to go about things &mdash; a design method that
involves creating shapes and then adding attributes to them after the
fact is equally as legitimate and just doesn't have a nice group of functions
to go along with it in Prelude.


<!-- This could be made an exercise instead, but I feel like it's more a functional programming problem than illustrative of the structure of our thin wrappers, so I just put the solution as an example here. However, I could be convinced otherwise, let me know what you think - Mitch -->

```
(defrec setFill_ (\(attrs fill)
  (case attrs
    ([]                   [['fill' fill]])
    ([['fill' _] | rest]  [['fill' fill] | rest])
    ([a | rest]           [a | (setFill_ rest fill)]))))

(def setFill (\([nodeName attrs children] fill)
  [nodeName (setFill_ attrs fill) children]))
```
 
Notice how we need to be careful about how the attributes themselves are
two-element lists inside of lists. This leads to more than a few nested
brackets, but the syntax should become familiar after you use it once or twice.

**Practice:** Enter this function into a file, and use it to set the fill of one
or more shapes. Then, modify the function to have it set a different attribute.

### SVG ViewBox

In all of our examples so far, we have used absolute coordinates (in pixels)
when defining the sizes and positions of SVG shapes. Because Scalable Vector
Graphics are, well, scalable, most of the time this is okay; most SVG editors
and viewers can resize these designs appropriately if needed. Sometimes,
however, an SVG image with absolute coordinates may not be resized
automatically, such as when embedding it into an HTML document.

<!--
Although much of the time the location in which you use the SVG images that you
create in Sketch-n-Sketch is such that it will scale the image appropriately,
-->

The best way to guarantee that your image (and any surrounding border spacing)
will be scaled appropriately is to specify an `viewBox` attribute for the
top-level `svg` canvas node, which defines a local coordinate system for the
design. The general structure of using a `viewBox` is that the top-level SVG
node ends up as follows:

```
<svg width="totalWidth" height="totalHeight" viewBox="minX minY maxX maxY">
  ...
</svg>
```

This creates an internal coordinate system for your design
that goes from `minX` to `maxX` in the x-direction and `minY` to `maxY`
in the y-direction. (Often, `minX` and `maxY` are both set to `0`,
effectively making `maxX` the `width` of the coordinate system and `maxY` the
`height`.)
This is offset by `minX` and `minY`, effectively defining a
rectangle within the `totalWidth` and `totalHeight` of your working svg
definition that is actually shown when it is rendered. If the `totalWidth` and
`totalHeight` parameters are omitted from the `svg` definition, then the
`viewBox` implicitly defines the width and height of the image, and the `minX`
and `minY` parameters can only specify a subset of the image that reaches all
the way to width and height.

<!-- ravi: i've stopped looking at this subsection here -->

Alright, that was all a bit specific. In general, a good way to think about a
`viewBox`, at least when it comes to exporting your images, is to start by
defining your SVG using raw pixel values (as we've been doing in this and
previous lessons). Then, when you're ready to export, change your call to `svg`
to a call to `svgViewBox` with the overall width and height of your image and
then right away your image will scale itself to fit its container! A great
example of this is in the Bar Graph example, which uses a variable called
`doneEditing` that, if set to `true`, renders the document using a `viewBox` and
if set to `false` doesn't. Further, it also doesn't render the helper slider
when `doneEditing` is set to `true`, making a convenient mechanism to switch
between a 'working' mode and an 'export' mode. In fact, if you're working with
any complicated graphic that uses UI Widgets, this setup makes for a very good
workflow.

To get a little more practice with `viewBox` as well as our thin wrapper syntax,
we're going to go through an example of how to make helper widgets to allow
panning and zooming around a larger graphic.

<!-- Proving more difficult than I thought to get this working. Will write this up tomorrow before we meet. - Mitch -->

### Adding a New SVG Feature

The built-in functions include the most commonly used SVG features, but
this set it is by no means exhaustive. Just as we did in the zoom and pan
example, we can use the thin wrapper syntax to add features of SVG that are not
built-in to our designs. In that case, we only needed to add attributes, but
there is no reason why whole new SVG node types cannot be added. For the last
topic of this tutorial, we're going to demonstrate how to incorporate an SVG element
that has currently has no special support from Sketch-n-Sketch.

<!-- implementation in `little`, and then you will implement your
own SVG node in `little`.
-->

A good reference for all the features of the most recent SVG specification can
be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). From this,
let's go ahead and implement the `animate` tag with some very simple attributes.
As with any additional element that you incorporate into little, there will be
no built-in zones that allow you to directly manipulate its attributes. However,
as we covered in a previous lesson, UI Widgets work very well for manipulating
the attributes of these elements despite this limitation.

The `animate` tag, in a simple form, takes the following structure:

```
<nodeToAnimaate itsAttributes>
  <animate  attributeType="XML"
            attributeName="attrName"
            from="attrMin" to="attrMax"
            dur="duration"
            repeatCount="indefinite or count"></animate>
</nodeToAnimate>
```

So, we will need to have a method of passing the above attributes into our
animate node and to remember that we need to insert the animate node as a child
node for whatever node we would like to vary over time. In our case, we can
assume that the `attributeType` will always be XML, so we won't pass that as an
argument to our function. So, we could define our `animate` function as follows:

```
(def animate (\(attrName from to dur repeat)
  ['animate'
    [ ['attributeType' 'XML']
      ['attributeName' attrName]
      ['from' (toString from)]
      ['to' (toString to)]
      ['dur' (+ (toString dur) 's')]
      ['repeatCount' repeat]
    ]
    []
  ] ) )
```

As with the shape functions from Prelude, this function provides a nicer way of
packaging together an SVG node without writing lists everywhere. Even better,
when calling the `animate` function, we can provide numeric values and rely on
this function to perform the `toString` conversions that are needed.

Now, we can create a rectangle that moves in the x-direction:

```
(def coolRect 
  [ 'rect'
    [ ['x' '100']
      ['y' '100']
      ['width' '100']
      ['height' '100']
    ]
    [ (animate 'x' 100 200 5 'indefinite') ]
  ]
)

(svg [coolRect])
```

Nice!

It's then straightforward to turn `coolRect` into a function that
takes an argument for the y-position, so we can draw many animated
rectangles on the screen at once:

```
(def coolRect (\ypos
  [ 'rect'
    [ ['x' '100']
      ['y' (toString ypos)]
      ['width' '100']
      ['height' '100']
    ]
    [ (animate 'x' 100 200 5 'indefinite') ]
  ]
) )

(svg (map coolRect [100 200 300 400 500]))
```

Now, we can programmatically generate animated rectangles with just as much
flexibility as we can any other shape, with the ability to change the low-level
placement function definitions to boot.

However, as you can see by turning on the zone view, the zones for these shapes
are not where you might expect them to be. Sketch-n-Sketch (currently) expects
shapes to remain in the same location, so it does not alter the positions of the
zones based on where they are in the animation. Furthermore, there are
(currently) no built-in tools to help work animations. If working on the edge of
what the built-in functionality allows, be ready for a little bit of strange
behavior here and there. That being said, our tool is expressive enough to allow
for any features of SVG to be expressed and still be able to take advantage of
the benefits of programmatically specifying the image.

**Exercise:** Now it's your turn. 
Pick a new SVG element or other non-built-in SVG structure and attempt to implement
it in Little. Good candidates include the `g` element, a filter, or a
gradient. Don't forget to look at the [SVG
documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) for inspiration
and implementation details.

### That's It

That's all the material we have for our basic tutorial! We hope that you have
enjoyed working with our tool and were able to make the designs you wanted to.
