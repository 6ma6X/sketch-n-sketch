# Step 5

What we will cover in this lesson:

- How to use the thin wrapper syntax to define SVG nodes that aren't built in

Cover how `svgViewBox` works
Go into detail about the `['nodeType' [attrs] [children]]` structure works

We need to use Prelude as an example for this; good examples are the defs for:

circle
ellipse
rect
line
polygon
polyline
path
text

Talking about addAttr is probably a good thing as well, as it simplifies some of
the function definitions tha do complicated things.

This lesson will focus on the implementation of a something that isn't currently
part of built-in functionality, after reimplementing something that is. So:

* Reimplement a shape or shapes
* Pick an SVG node type (anything from
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/SVG/Element works, especially
  something unusual like feTurbulence) and implement it
* Focus on how to structure this as a function that is reusable so that you can
  use it in your later designs
* Ask the user to impelement an element that looks cool to them. It's okay to
  reimplement one that we have already (so long as you don't peek!)
