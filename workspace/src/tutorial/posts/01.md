# Step 2

What this second lesson will cover
- What sorts of parameters are 'Indirect', and how to set them up to be manipulated
- Freezing and thawing parameters to control what is directly manipulated
- The Group Box pattern

## Direct and Indirect Parameters

P1
- The terminology 'Direct parameter' and 'indirect parameter' means those parameters which are a direct part of the output (such as the width of a shape) and those parameters which go into the calculation of part of the output but are related in a more complicated way than simply a single number to a single attribute.
- A good example of this is the 'Logo' example. In this, the 'delta' parameter is an indirect parameter of the output. It definitely represents some characteristic of the output, but there's no one value (width, position, etc.) in any of the shapes that corresponds precisely to the delta.
- One of the real strengths of our approach to designing graphics is that you can define such indirect parameters in the program and then, usually without too much effort, "structure things" (need a better way to say this) to be able to manipulate it directly with a mouse in the output.

P2
- The best way to get at this is to work through an example. Let's revisit the three shapes example that we worked through in the last lesson.
- Define a `placeShape` that takes one parameter, `index`. 
- Define helper variables `x0` and `sep`
- Define the x position as `(+ x0 (* sep index))`. Now, redefine `manyShapes` as this mapped over a list of indices that includes zero. Hit run.

P3
- In this example, x0 has a direct representation in the output. The x position of the 'zeroth' box is exacly x0. So, by manipulating the 'zeroth' box center, you're directly manipulating that parameter.
- Separation, however, does not have a direct represenation in the output. There's no value of the output that is just the separation, but it is a characteristic of the output nonetheless.
- Since it goes into the calculation of the x position of the non-zeroth boxes, manipulating their position can change this value. Try manipulating the position of one of the other boxes and observing how the separation parameter changes. Notice that this also affects the other boxes, as most indirect parameters will.
- Try adding another indirect parameter to your example. Can you manipulate it? Is it intuitive?
  * Suggest ysep in addition to xsep, making the y value also in terms of index
  * Maybe suggest something more complex like a 'scale' parameter that acts as an additional modifier on the width and height of the boxes after defining the width and height in terms of index.

## Freezing and Thawing + Associated Workflows

P1
- If you went and did the more complex suggestions, you likely realized that the amount of parameters that you are manipulating at once when you are playing with the output can get unwieldy rather quickly. One solution to this is freezing parameters.
- Freezing parameters helps you pinpoint/zero in on exactly what characteristics of the graphic you would like to be manipulating at any given time.
- To freeze a parameter, add a bang after the *number* that represents its value. There will only ever be one of these. Note that you cannot annotate a variable name with a bang.
- Try freezing one of the parameters of your example (or, you know, one of the built-in ones like x0 in the three boxes example) and then comparing what changes when you manipulate the output now as opposed to before you froze it.

P2
- A good pattern of design/workflow that seems to be effective is to, as you design your graphic, freeze the parameters that you have gotten how you like them. Then, if you decide to manipulate them later, unfreeze them. This lets you avoid accidentally changing what you've done before as you make more and more complicated graphics.
- As an example take a look at one of the later examples, such as (French Sudan? Solar System?), and observe how a lot of the parameters have been frozen. (Maybe we don't want to point them to these? Perhaps the prospect of having to freeze parameters all over the place will be a bit disheartening?)

## General Structure of more complicated graphics, and the utility of the Group Box pattern, and the Chicago Flag

P1
- Perhaps suprisingly, one of the parameters that ends up being indirect in almost all designs is the overall width and height of the graphic.
- A helpful design pattern for this case is the Group Box.
- Explain how to go about defining a group box, and how to manipulate it.

P2
- One such example of a graphic that benefits from this a flag. Since we're based out of Chicago, we'll now step through the development of a Chicago Flag (one of the built-in examples, which you can cheat and look at if you have no shame) using our tool. We'll be making use of freezing constants, the group box, and all the things we learned in the last lesson.
- Walk through how to make the Chicago Flag example. Point out Prelude and how it's a good idea to look through it to get a sense of the tools that are provided to you. In particular, it's how you would have found out about `nStar`.

P3
- Your turn!
- Pick the flag of a country (not one that is in the examples) and recreate it. Be sure to use a group box to be able to adjust the overall size. Change the output type to SVG, save it, and revel in how awesome you are.
