## Direct and Indirect Parameters

When making designs, there are often two types of parameters that come up.
Direct parameters are the kinds of parameters that we dealt with in the last
lesson - these are parameters that completely determine some attribute of the
output. As such, manipulating that attribute in the output will lead to a
straightforward change in the input program. Indirect parameters are those
parameters which go into the calculation of part of the output, but are related
in a more complicated way than simply a single number to a single attribute. A
good example of this is the built-in `Logo` example. In this design, the 
`delta` parameter is an indirect parameter of the output. It definitely
represents some characteristic of the output, but there's no one value (width, 
position, etc.)
in any of the shapes that corresponds precisely to `delta`. One of the real
strengths to [[our approach]] to designing graphics is that you can express such
indirect parameters in the source program and then organize your output in such
a way as to be able to manipulate it in an intuitive fashion. The best way to
get at this is to work through an example. Lets revisit the three shapes example
that we worked through in the last lesson.

Once you've loaded it (or rewritten it quickly), define two variables at the start of your program `x0` and `separation`. As a reminder, you can define variables using the `def` syntax as follows:

```
(def [x0 separation] [100 200])
```

Remember that you need to define any variables before you use them in your program, so make sure that this definition comes before any other statements in your program. Now, redefine your `placeShape` function to, instead of taking an x-position, take an index instead. So, the x-position of your shape will have value `(+ x0 (* sep index))`. Next, redefine your equivalent of 
`manyShapes` to be mapped over a list of indices instead of x-positions, for the purposes of this example making sure that `0` is one of the indices. After doing this, run the program and examine your output. Feel free to manipulate the shapes a bit to get them all in view.

In this case, `x0` has a direct representation in the output. The x-position of the 'zeroth' box is exactly `x0` and manipulating that position will completely determine the value of `x0`. Our other variable, `separation`, does not have such a direct representation. There is no single value of the output that completely determined by `separation`, but it is a characteristic of the design nonetheless. Since it goes into the calculation of the x-position for the boxes that do not have index zero, manipulating the x-position of these shapes can change the value of separation. Try manipulating the x-position of these other shapes and observing how `separation` is affected. Notice that this change also affects other shapes, as most indirect parameters will.

Try adding another indirect parameter to your example. This could be anything; one parameter you could add is a `yseparation` parameter in addition to the existing one that also changes the y-position of the shapes depending on the index. You could also try something a that affects other attributes of the shapes, like a `scale` parameter that changes the width, height, or size in some other sense for the shape. Can you manipulate your parameter or parameters? Is the manipulation intutitive?

P1
- The terminology 'Direct parameter' and 'indirect parameter' means those parameters which are a direct part of the output (such as the width of a shape) and those parameters which go into the calculation of part of the output but are related in a more complicated way than simply a single number to a single attribute.
- A good example of this is the 'Logo' example. In this, the 'delta' parameter is an indirect parameter of the output. It definitely represents some characteristic of the output, but there's no one value (width, position, etc.) in any of the shapes that corresponds precisely to the delta.
- One of the real strengths of our approach to designing graphics is that you can define such indirect parameters in the program and then, usually without too much effort, "structure things" (need a better way to say this) to be able to manipulate it directly with a mouse in the output.

P2
- The best way to get at this is to work through an example. Let's revisit the three shapes example that we worked through in the last lesson.
- Define a `placeShape` that takes one parameter, `index`. 
- Define helper variables `x0` and `sep`
- Define the x position as `(+ x0 (* sep index))`. Now, redefine `manyShapes` as this mapped over a list of indices that includes zero. Hit run.

P3
- In this example, x0 has a direct representation in the output. The x position of the 'zeroth' box is exacly x0. So, by manipulating the 'zeroth' box center, you're directly manipulating that parameter.
- Separation, however, does not have a direct represenation in the output. There's no value of the output that is just the separation, but it is a characteristic of the output nonetheless.
- Since it goes into the calculation of the x position of the non-zeroth boxes, manipulating their position can change this value. Try manipulating the position of one of the other boxes and observing how the separation parameter changes. Notice that this also affects the other boxes, as most indirect parameters will.
- Try adding another indirect parameter to your example. Can you manipulate it? Is it intuitive?
  * Suggest ysep in addition to xsep, making the y value also in terms of index
  * Maybe suggest something more complex like a 'scale' parameter that acts as an additional modifier on the width and height of the boxes after defining the width and height in terms of index.

## Freezing and Thawing + Associated Workflows

If you implemented one of the more complex suggestions, you likely realized that the amount of parameters that you are manipulating at once when you are changing parts of the output can get unwieldy rather quickly. Sketch-n-Sketch helps a little bit by limiting the number of parameters each zone can change at a time,[^zonerotationtechnical] but a friendlier way to control what attributes you would like to manipulate at any given time is to freeze those constants you would like to remain unchanged no matter what manipulation you are about to make. To freeze a constant, add a bang (`!`) after the *number* that represents its value. As there will only ever be one number in the program that represents the value of a particular constant you never have to worry about inadvertantly being ambiguous with this specificiation.

[^zonerotationtechnical]: For more details, see section 5.2, "Zone Assignments" in our [technical report](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02988v1.pdf).

Depending on which indices you chose in your `manyShapes` definition, you may have noticed that manipulating certain shapes actually changes the *index* associated with it rather than the separation parameter or the initial x-position. Usually, if you structure your part of your design around a `map placeShape indicies` statement, it is a good idea to freeze all of your indices. After all, usually it's not the index of the shape that you would like to change!  

Try freezing some of the parameters in your design and seeing how that impacts what you can manipulate. You could also try freezing some of the parameters in the built-in examples, like Three Boxes, and observing the impact there.

A good workflow that seems to be effective is to, as you design your graphic, freeze the parametrs that you adjusted to how you would like them to be. Then, if you decide to manipulate them later, you can unfreeze them. This lets you avoid accidentally changing what you've done before as you make more and  more complicated graphics. To demonstrate, take a look at one of the later examples such as Wikimedia Logo or Eye Icon and observe how freezing constants has been utilized to limit the sorts of things that can be changed.

P1
- If you went and did the more complex suggestions, you likely realized that the amount of parameters that you are manipulating at once when you are playing with the output can get unwieldy rather quickly. One solution to this is freezing parameters.
- Freezing parameters helps you pinpoint/zero in on exactly what characteristics of the graphic you would like to be manipulating at any given time.
- To freeze a parameter, add a bang after the *number* that represents its value. There will only ever be one of these. Note that you cannot annotate a variable name with a bang.
- Try freezing one of the parameters of your example (or, you know, one of the built-in ones like x0 in the three boxes example) and then comparing what changes when you manipulate the output now as opposed to before you froze it.

P2
- A good pattern of design/workflow that seems to be effective is to, as you design your graphic, freeze the parameters that you have gotten how you like them. Then, if you decide to manipulate them later, unfreeze them. This lets you avoid accidentally changing what you've done before as you make more and more complicated graphics.
- As an example take a look at one of the later examples, such as (French Sudan? Solar System?), and observe how a lot of the parameters have been frozen. (Maybe we don't want to point them to these? Perhaps the prospect of having to freeze parameters all over the place will be a bit disheartening?)

## General Structure of more complicated graphics, and the utility of the Group Box pattern, and the Chicago Flag

Perhaps suprisingly, one of the parameters that ends up being indirect in almost all designs in the overall width and height of the graphic. In cases where the ability to change the overall width and height is desirable, a useful design pattern to employ is a Group Box. The idea behind a Group Box is to define at least two parameters that represent the width and height of the design and then have an 'invisible' box behind the visible portion of the graphic that allows you to manipulate them. Then, you define the rest of your graphic in terms of this width and height, making it such that changes to the overall width and height will sclae the rest of your graphic appropriately. In addition to these width and height parameters, it can be useful to define an x-offset and y-offset parameter as well, which allows for the translation of the entire design.

One such example that benefits from this is a flag, as it is a design that often needs to be translated and scaled when used in other graphics. Since we're based out of Chicago, we'll step through the development of a recreation of the Chicago flag to give a sense of how exactly the Group Box pattern is implemented. Further, we'll be making use of freezing constants and all of the things that we learned in the last lesson.

Steps:
Define Group Box
Define Blue Bars
Define N Star
Define NStars
Done!

When using the Group Box pattern, it is helpful to define the group box first.
So, let's define overall width, height, initial x, and initial y values that
will be used to position and proportion our box. Then, define a group box that
has position and dimension exactly equal to those values. The most important
part of a group box is that it doesn't show up in the image, so defining the box
with an RGBA color with an Alpha of zero, making it transparent, is a good call. 
So, all together, we could have:

```
(def [x0 y0 w h] [100 100 800 600])
(def groupBox (rect [255 255 255 0] x0 y0 w h))
```

Once you've defined this, put your `groupBox` into an `svg` definition at the
end of your program, turn on the viewing of the simple zones, and resize it to 
your liking. Now, all the graphics you
define should go inside the boundaries of this box and have their proportions
tied to the size and position of the group box. It's important to remember that
the shapes shouldn't completely overlap the zones for the manipulation of the
group box, otherwise you will not be able to adjust those parameters. For 
instance, the blue stripes (the CSS color 'lightblue' is a close enough color 
match) should be positioned such that you can still manipulate the underlying
group box. So, the following definition would be a good way to define the
stripes (keeping in mind, of course, the [official
proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Chicago) ):

```
(def stripes [ (rect 'lightblue' (+ x0 (/ w 5!)) (+ y0 (/ h 7!)) (* 4! (/ w 5!)) (/ h 6!))
               (rect 'lightblue' (+ x0 (/ w 5!)) (+ y0 (* 5! (/ h 7!))) (* 4! (/ w 5!)) (/ h 6!)) ])
```

Note that we've frozen all of the constants that we use to do the proportioning
of the shapes, as we don't want to accidentally directly manipulate them later.
Next, we need to do the six-pointed stars that run horizontally across the
middle of the design. Doing the design for a six-pointed star is an interesting
exercise in its own right, but it's a common enough shape that we've made a 
built-in function to generate n-pointed stars, `nStar` (If you're interested in
how it's implemented, check out the Stars example). The `nStar` function takes
arguments of the following form:

```
(nStar fill stroke w n len1 len2 rot cx cy)
```

Where the arguments have the following meanings:

* `fill` is the color of the fill of the star 
* `stroke` is the color of the outline of the star ('none' is an acceptable and commonly used value)
* `w` is the width of the outline
* `n` is the number of points on the star
* `len1` is the length from the center of the star to the outer points
* `len2` is the length from the center of the star to the inner points 
* `rot` is the amount of clockwise rotation in radians
* `cx` is the x-position of the center of the star
* `cy` is the y-position of the center of the star

Lots of arguments! To define a six-pointed star with the appropriate color and
dimensions, we could do the following:

```
(def placeStar (\i 
  (nStar 'red' 'none' 0! 6! (/ h 10!) (/ h 25!) 0! 
    (+ x0 (* 3! (* i (/ (/ w 5!) 5!)))) (/ h 2)))
```

Then, we can define all of our stars with the following map:

```
(def stars (map placeStar [1 2 3 4]))
```

Putting this into the `svg` declaration at the bottom of our program, we then
have our flag! 

Now that you've seen how to use the Group Box pattern in a design, it's your
turn! Go ahead and pick the flag of a country or city (not one that is already in the examples) and recreate it. 
Be sure to use a Group Box to be able to adjust the overall size!

P1
- Perhaps suprisingly, one of the parameters that ends up being indirect in almost all designs is the overall width and height of the graphic.
- A helpful design pattern for this case is the Group Box.
- Explain how to go about defining a group box, and how to manipulate it.

P2
- One such example of a graphic that benefits from this a flag. Since we're based out of Chicago, we'll now step through the development of a Chicago Flag (one of the built-in examples, which you can cheat and look at if you have no shame) using our tool. We'll be making use of freezing constants, the group box, and all the things we learned in the last lesson.
- Walk through how to make the Chicago Flag example. Point out Prelude and how it's a good idea to look through it to get a sense of the tools that are provided to you. In particular, it's how you would have found out about `nStar`.

P3
- Your turn!
- Pick the flag of a country (not one that is in the examples) and recreate it. Be sure to use a group box to be able to adjust the overall size. Change the output type to SVG, save it, and revel in how awesome you are.
